# Gameplay Observations

Raw session logs and pattern notes for Babel RPG and experiment sessions.

## Purpose
Accumulate enough real outputs to distinguish emergent patterns from noise.
Target: 10+ RPG runs before drawing conclusions about emergence patterns.

## Files
- `session-logs/` — per-session turn dumps (auto-generated by query_turns.py)
- `deferred-patterns.md` — patterns spotted but unverified; review after 10+ runs
- `confirmed-patterns.md` — patterns seen 3+ times across different sessions

## How to log a session
```powershell
# From project root:
.venv\Scripts\python.exe query_turns.py --export <match_id>
# Saves to gameplay-observations/session-logs/<match_id>.md
```
(query_turns.py export flag to be added when logging is formalised)
