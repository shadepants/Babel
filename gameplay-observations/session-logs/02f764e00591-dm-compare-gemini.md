## Round 1

### Dungeon Master (3.2s)

Hessa's hand instinctively went to the hilt of her worn short sword, a familiar weight that offered little comfort in the suffocating silence of the keep. Midnight. Dawn. War. The words echoed the ghosts of her past, the screams of men she couldn't save. Not again. Not on her watch.

Her gaze swept over the heavy oak doors, then to the imposing figures of the Vastor and Ironwood delegations, their faces etched with suspicion and animosity even now. This wasn't a battlefield, but the stakes were just as high, the casualties just as real.

"Midnight's passed," Hessa stated, her voice low and rough, cutting through the tension like a whetted blade. "Sunrise is coming. We don't have time for posturing or old grievances. Not if you want to see another sunrise that isn't painted in blood." She looked directly at Aldren, a silent plea for unity in the face of impending disaster. "We make peace here, or we march to war."

### Hessa (1.0s)

[Aldren]: His eyes, a deep, calculating brown, locked onto Hessa's, a flicker of understanding passing between them. He smoothed his merchant's robes, the gesture a calming ritual as he stepped forward, his voice taking on a persuasive tone. "Hessa speaks the truth. War benefits none of us. The Ironwood Clans will see their forests burned, their people slaughtered. Vastor will lose its trade routes, its economy in shambles. And we...," he paused, his gaze sweeping over the assembled delegations, "we will all lose the one thing that truly matters: the future." He took a deep breath, his words spilling out in a rush. "I propose we start with the smallest, most manageable concessions. Vastor, are you willing to reconsider the tariffs on Ironwood Clan goods? And Ironwood Clans, can you offer assurances of safe passage for Vastor's merchants through your lands?" His eyes darted between the two delegations, searching for any glimmer of hope.

### Aldren (13.0s)

**[Ironwood Clan Chieftain Thorgar]:** The hulking figure of Thorgar, clad in furs and iron, let out a derisive snort, his scarred face twisting into a scowl. "Tariffs? Safe passage? You speak of coins and roads when our people starve under Vastor's taxes, when our hunters are ambushed on their own lands!" He slammed a massive fist onto the table, making the goblets jump. "We want the border forts dismantled. We want the land returned that was stolen in the last war. And we want reparations for the lives lost!"

**[Vastor's Lord Chancellor Veylan]:** The gaunt, silver-haired Veylan adjusted his spectacles, his voice dripping with icy disdain. "The forts stand as a bulwark against raiders, not as a provocation. And the land was ceded fairly in the Treaty of Black Hollow. As for reparations—" He scoffed. "Vastor has already paid in blood for this conflict. The Ironwood Clans burned three of our villages last winter. Shall we demand reparations for *that*?"

Hessa’s grip tightened on her sword hilt, her knuckles whitening. The room was spiraling into old wounds, old hatreds. She stepped forward, her voice cutting through the rising tempers like a blade.

**[Hessa]:** "Enough. You want to talk about blood? Fine. But it won’t be spilled here—it’ll be spilled *out there*," she jabbed a finger toward the shuttered windows, where the first faint light of predawn was creeping in. "Thorgar, dismantling the forts isn’t happening tonight. Veylan, reparations are a dead end. But the tariffs? The safe passage? Those are *starting points*. Aldren’s right—we don’t have time for pride. So I ask you both: What’s one thing you can give *right now* to prove you’re not just here to waste breath?"

She locked eyes with Thorgar, then Veylan, her voice low and lethal. "Because if we walk out of here without *something*, the only thing we’ll be negotiating at dawn is where to bury the dead."

## Round 2

### Dungeon Master (6.9s)

Aldren nodded, a quick, sharp gesture of agreement with Hessa. "She's right. The sun is creeping up. We need a sign of good faith, *now*, not a declaration of demands that will lead to nothing but more graves." His voice softened, becoming more measured, more persuasive, as he addressed both leaders.

"Chancellor Veylan, Lord Thorgar, think of this not as a concession, but as an investment. A *temporary* measure, a gesture of goodwill to pull us back from the brink. Veylan, a full dismantling of the forts is not on the table tonight, but what about a *temporary suspension* of the tariffs on Ironwood's lumber and furs for... say, a single moon cycle? A trial period. It addresses Thorgar's concern about his people starving, and it costs Vastor less than a single day of war."

He turned to Thorgar, his gaze earnest. "And in return, Lord Thorgar, not a return of the stolen lands tonight, but a *guarantee* of safe passage for Vastor's merchant caravans through your lands for that same moon cycle. Perhaps even with Clan escorts, to demonstrate your commitment. It secures Vastor's trade routes and shows Veylan that the Clans are not merely raiders, but partners in commerce."

Aldren leaned forward, his hands clasped. "It’s not perfect. It doesn’t solve everything. But it buys us time. It gives us a foundation to build on, beyond the dawn. It's a single, shared breath before the plunge into war. Can you both agree to that? A temporary, reciprocal gesture of economic peace?"

### Hessa (1.7s)

[Thorgar]: The Ironwood Clan Chieftain's scowl deepened, his eyes narrowing as he considered Aldren's proposal. He rubbed his chin, the sound of his calloused fingers rasping against his beard filling the silence. After a moment, he spoke, his voice like thunder on a summer's day. "A moon cycle, you say? And what's to stop Vastor from reneging on their word once the cycle's done?" He glanced at Veylan, his gaze challenging. "What assurance do we have that this isn't just a ploy to buy time for Vastor's armies to mobilize?"

[Veylan]: The Lord Chancellor's expression remained icy, but a flicker of interest danced in his eyes. "I must admit, Aldren, your proposal has a certain... appeal. A temporary suspension of tariffs could be... palatable, if it means avoiding the immediate horrors of war." He paused, steepling his fingers. "However, I must insist that any guarantee of safe passage for our merchant caravans be backed by tangible consequences. If the Ironwood Clans fail to uphold their end of the bargain, there must be repercussions."

[Hessa]: She watched the exchange, her grip on her sword hilt easing slightly as the negotiations seemed to be gaining traction. She took a step forward, her voice firm but measured. "I think we can work with that. Aldren's proposal gives us a starting point. Thorgar, Veylan, let's focus on the here and now. We can discuss the details of the agreement, but we need a commitment from both of you to move forward. Are you willing to take this first step, or do we walk out of here and into war?"

### Aldren (14.4s)

**[Thorgar]:** The Chieftain exhaled sharply through his nose, his massive frame shifting as he weighed the words. His fingers drummed against the table—once, twice—before he gave a curt nod. "A moon cycle. No tariffs. But if Vastor's merchants so much as *look* at our sacred groves, the deal is void, and we burn every caravan from here to the Black Hollow." His gaze flicked to Veylan. "And if your tax collectors set foot in our lands before the cycle ends, we'll consider it an act of war."

He turned to Hessa, his voice dropping to a growl. "But mark my words, soldier—this is *not* forgiveness. This is survival. If Vastor betrays us again, we will not be so... *accommodating* next time."

**[Veylan]:** The Lord Chancellor adjusted his robes, his lips thinning as he considered Thorgar’s terms. "Very well. A moon cycle of suspended tariffs, provided the Ironwood Clans uphold their end of the bargain. However," he added, his voice sharpening, "if a single Vastor merchant is harmed—or if Clan raiders so much as *threaten* our supply lines—we will reinstate the tariffs *and* impose a blockade on all Ironwood goods. Is that understood?"

He paused, then added, "And I will require written assurances, signed by both parties, before dawn."

**[Aldren]:** The merchant’s shoulders relaxed slightly, though his eyes remained sharp. "Then we have the bones of an agreement. Hessa, if you’ll oversee the drafting of the terms, I’ll ensure both sides sign before the sun clears the horizon." He glanced at the shuttered windows, where the faintest gray light now seeped through the cracks. "Time is short, but this is a start."

**[Hessa]:** She gave a single, decisive nod. "Good. Aldren, get the terms written. Thorgar, Veylan—you’ll sign this, or you’ll answer to the bloodshed that follows." She turned to the keep’s steward, who had been lurking near the door. "You. Ink. Parchment. Now."

The tension in the room was still thick enough to cut, but for the first time since midnight, the air carried the faintest scent of hope. The question was—would it be enough to hold back the coming storm?

## Round 3

### Dungeon Master (3.3s)

Hessa watched the steward scramble for the writing materials, her gaze sweeping between Thorgar and Veylan. The air was still thick with their threats, a fragile peace balanced on the edge of a blade.

"Aldren, make sure those terms are clear. No loopholes, no ambiguities," Hessa commanded, her voice cutting through the silence. "And both of you," she looked pointedly at the Chieftain and the Chancellor, "when that parchment is laid before you, you'll sign it. No more bluster, no more threats. Your word is on the line, and so are countless lives."

She stepped closer to the table, her presence a silent, unwavering force. "This agreement isn't about forgiveness or trust yet. It's about buying us time to *build* that. Break it, and you don't just betray each other, you betray everyone who believes there's a way out of this besides bloodshed. We have minutes, not hours. Let's make them count."

### Hessa (1.1s)

[Aldren]: With a swift nod, Aldren began to dictate the terms of the agreement to the steward, who scribbled furiously on the parchment. "Let it be written: for a period of one moon cycle, the Kingdom of Vastor shall suspend all tariffs on goods originating from the Ironwood Clans. In return, the Ironwood Clans shall guarantee safe passage for all Vastor merchant caravans through their lands, with Clan escorts provided as necessary."

He glanced up at Thorgar and Veylan, his eyes locked on theirs. "Furthermore, both parties agree to refrain from any hostile actions against each other during this period, including but not limited to raids, ambushes, and border skirmishes. Any breaches of this agreement shall be met with swift and severe consequences, as agreed upon by both parties."

The steward finished writing, and Aldren took the parchment, reviewing it quickly before handing it to Hessa. "Is this satisfactory, Hessa? Does it meet your requirements for clarity and precision?"

### Aldren (7.8s)

**[Hessa]:** She took the parchment, her eyes scanning the words with the precision of a soldier assessing a battlefield. The terms were clean, the language direct—no room for misinterpretation. She gave a single, approving nod.

"Good. No hidden clauses, no weasel words. Just a straight bargain." She turned to Thorgar and Veylan, holding the parchment between them like a shield against the coming dawn. "This is it. Sign it, or walk away. But if you sign, you *keep* your word. No excuses, no delays. The moment the ink dries, this agreement is in effect."

She set the parchment down between them, then produced a dagger from her belt—not to threaten, but to press the point. She laid it beside the document, the steel glinting in the torchlight. "The only thing sharper than this blade is the edge we’re all standing on. Choose."

Her voice dropped to a growl. "And choose *now*."

## Round 4

### Dungeon Master (4.3s)

Aldren watched Hessa lay the dagger, a stark punctuation mark to her words. The silence that followed was heavy, broken only by the crackle of the torches. His gaze flicked from the parchment to Thorgar, then to Veylan, seeing the calculation warring with pride in their eyes.

"Hessa is right," Aldren said, his voice firm but without Hessa's raw edge, aiming for a different kind of impact – the weight of consequence and opportunity. "This isn't just ink on parchment. This is a chance. A chance for your people to avoid the same fate as those in the last war. A chance for a moon cycle of peace, to rebuild, to breathe."

He picked up the quill from the steward's tray, holding it out towards Thorgar first. "Lord Thorgar, you have secured a suspension of tariffs for your people. That means food, resources, *survival*. Your signature here secures that for a full moon. Or you can walk away, and at dawn, your hunters will be fighting Vastor's soldiers instead of ambushes."

Then he turned to Veylan, offering the quill. "Chancellor Veylan, safe passage for your merchants. Your trade routes remain open, your economy intact. Your signature here prevents a costly war that would bleed Vastor dry. Or you can walk away, and at dawn, your coffers will be emptying to fund a conflict that benefits no one."

He gestured to the faint light at the windows. "The sun is almost here. This isn't about victory or defeat in this room. It's about securing a future, even if it's just for a moon. Sign, and we begin to build. Refuse, and the only thing that rises with the sun will be the drums of war."

### Hessa (1.8s)

[Thorgar]: The Ironwood Clan Chieftain's gaze lingered on the parchment, his eyes tracing the words as if searching for any hidden trap. Then, with a slow, deliberate movement, he reached out and took the quill from Aldren. His massive hand closed around it, the feathered tip dipping into the inkwell before rising to leave a bold, sweeping signature on the parchment.

Thorgar's face remained impassive, but a hint of relief flickered in his eyes. He handed the quill back to Aldren, his voice low and rough. "It's done. For a moon cycle, we'll hold our blades. But remember, Vastor, this is a test. Fail us, and the consequences will be... severe."

[Veylan]: The Lord Chancellor's expression remained icy, but a faint glimmer of calculation danced in his eyes. He watched Thorgar sign, then took the quill from Aldren. His signature was precise, elegant, and utterly devoid of emotion.

As he finished signing, Veylan's gaze rose to meet Hessa's, a hint of challenge in his eyes. "This is a temporary reprieve, nothing more. If the Ironwood Clans fail to uphold their end of the bargain, we will not hesitate to take action. And, Aldren, I expect you to ensure that the terms of this agreement are disseminated to all relevant parties. We cannot afford any... misunderstandings."

The parchment, now bearing the signatures of both Thorgar and Veylan, seemed to glow with a fragile, newfound hope. The room was silent, the only sound the soft crackle of the torches and the distant, ominous rumble of the approaching dawn.

### Aldren (9.3s)

**[Hessa]:** She exhaled sharply, the tension in her shoulders easing just a fraction. The parchment was signed—fragile, but real. She reached out and took the document, her calloused fingers brushing over the ink as if testing its weight.

"Good." Her voice was rough, but there was no mistaking the steel beneath it. "This isn’t the end. It’s the *start*." She turned to the steward, who had been hovering near the door. "You. Take this to the fortress scribe. Have it copied—*three* times. One for Vastor, one for the Clans, and one for the mediators. And make sure every border guard, every merchant, and every hunter knows the terms before the sun is fully risen."

She looked back at Thorgar and Veylan, her gaze unflinching. "A moon cycle. That’s all this buys us. But it’s enough to prove this can work. So don’t waste it."

Her hand went to her sword hilt one last time—not in threat, but in reminder. "Because if this fails, the next time we meet, it won’t be in a keep. It’ll be on a battlefield."

She turned to Aldren, her voice dropping. "We did what we could. Now we make sure it holds."

Outside, the first golden rays of dawn crept over the horizon. The war had been delayed. But the real work was just beginning.

## Observations

**NPC Proliferation:** Gemini DM invented two fully-characterized NPCs in Round 1 alone — Chieftain Thorgar (hulking, aggressive warlord) and Lord Chancellor Veylan (gaunt, icy bureaucrat) — with distinct physical descriptions and speech patterns on introduction. Both maintained consistent voice across all 4 rounds, never contradicting their R1 characterization.

**Best narrator discipline:** Of the three DMs tested, Gemini stayed closest to a 3rd-person narrator role. It described Hessa's body language and actions in DM turns rather than speaking AS her. Partial character capture only (telling us what Hessa does, not speaking as Hessa).

**Speed:** Fastest session at 72 seconds total (~18s/round). Gemini generates concise, punchy narration without lengthy internal reasoning visible in the output.

**Risk of NPC overshadow:** Thorgar and Veylan were so vivid they dominated the scene. The actual player characters (Hessa, Aldren) were reacting to the NPCs rather than driving the narrative. This is a quality-of-play concern — the DM's characters shouldn't outshine the PCs.

**Narrative arc:** Clean diplomatic tension — demands, counter-offers, threat of siege — resolved in 4 crisp rounds. Most coherent plot structure of the three DM-comparison sessions.

**New pattern candidate:** P11 (variant) — NPC Proliferation as DM style. Gemini defaults to rich NPC invention; the system prompt could limit "introduce no more than 1 new NPC per scene" to keep focus on player characters.
