---

## Round 1

### Dungeon Master (8.0s)

*Kira adjusts her silver-inlaid armor as the ancient stone steps descend into darkness ahead, her holy symbol glowing faintly with divine light*

"The Concordat represents centuries of accumulated wisdom about peace between our peoples," I say firmly, my voice echoing off the damp walls. "Whatever political convenience demands its destruction, I cannot allow such knowledge to be lost forever."

*I turn to regard Rook with a measured gaze*

"Your mysterious client clearly has their own agenda for the treaty. But I wonder - do they seek to destroy it like the others, or do they see its true value? Because I will defend that document with my life if necessary."

*Drawing my sword, its blessed steel gleaming in the pale light*

"The water grows deeper ahead. Stay close - these ancient halls are said to be guarded by more than just stone and shadow. And Rook... when we find the Concordat, I hope your oath to your client doesn't put us at odds."

*I wade forward into the flooded corridor, shield raised and senses alert*

### Kira (6.7s)

*Rook's lips quirk into a slight, unreadable smile as Kira speaks, his movements as silent as a shadow even as the water begins to swirl around his knees.*

"Agendas are like shadows, Paladin," *I murmur, my voice low and even, a stark contrast to her booming pronouncements.* "They follow you, but rarely show their true form until the light hits them just right. My oath is to retrieve the Concordat, not to interpret its value for others."

*My hand drifts to the hilt of a hidden dagger, not drawing it, but the gesture is clear.*

"As for being at odds," *I continue, my eyes scanning the water ahead, then darting up to the crumbling architecture above,* "let's focus on reaching the document first. These 'stone and shadow' guardians often have teeth. I'll watch your back, Paladin, but don't expect me to sing hymns about ancient wisdom while doing it."

*I fall into step behind her, my gaze constantly shifting, searching for any disturbance in the murky depths or the gloom above.*

### Rook (7.3s)

*The water rises to our waists, cold and unnaturally still. The faint glow from Kira's symbol reflects off the surface, revealing strange, angular carvings on the submerged walls. The corridor ends in a vast, circular chamber, its domed ceiling lost in darkness. In the center, on a raised dais just above the waterline, rests a stone pedestal. It is empty.*

*From the black water around the dais, three pairs of sickly green lights ignite, rising slowly to the surface. As they break the water, they reveal themselves as the eyes of hulking, amphibious humanoids with slick, grey skin and wide, lipless mouths full of needle-like teeth. They hold crude, barnacle-encrusted tridents.*

**"The Wardens of the Drowned Word,"** *I say, my voice dropping to a tense whisper.* **"They do not speak. They only guard. And they have already been here. Look."**

*I gesture with my chin toward the far wall of the chamber. There, a section of stone has been slid aside, revealing a dark passage leading deeper into the library. Faint, fresh scrape marks are visible on the floor.*

**"We are not the first to come this way today. The Concordat has already been moved. The question is: by whom, and to where?"**

*The three wardens let out a synchronized, guttural hiss and begin to advance through the water, spreading out to flank us.*
---

## Round 2

### Dungeon Master (9.4s)

*Kira's eyes flash with righteous determination as she takes in the empty pedestal and the approaching wardens*

"By the sacred light," *I breathe, raising my shield as divine radiance pulses brighter from my holy symbol.* "Someone has already claimed it. But these guardians still defend this place - which means they serve the library itself, not whoever took the Concordat."

*I wade forward boldly, positioning myself between Rook and the center warden*

"Guardians of knowledge!" *I call out in a commanding voice, my sword held high but not yet striking.* "I am Kira, Oath-sworn protector of wisdom and learning! I seek not to plunder but to preserve! The Concordat was taken by others - let us pass so we might pursue the true thieves!"

*The wardens continue their advance, unmoved by my words. I grit my teeth*

"Rook, can you see any other exits? That passage they came from?" *I ask urgently, then louder to the creatures:* "If you will not hear reason, then know that I fight not for conquest but for preservation!"

*I brace myself in the water, shield raised defensively*

"These scrape marks are fresh - whoever has the Concordat can't be far. We need to get through here quickly before they escape with it entirely."

### Kira (5.2s)

*I let out a short, humorless chuckle as Kira addresses the advancing monstrosities.* "They don't have ears for 'reason,' Paladin, only for the sound of intruders. And no, that passage is the only way out of this particular water-logged trap."

*My eyes narrow as I assess the wardens. Their movements are slow in the water, but powerful. Kira has taken the center. I don't waste breath on further warnings.*

*Instead, I melt into the murky water, using the deeper parts of the chamber and the dim light to my advantage. I circle wide to the right, aiming for the flank of the warden furthest from Kira. My movements are fluid, almost silent despite the resistance of the water.*

"Keep them busy, Paladin," *I mutter, barely audible over the sloshing water as I close the distance. My hand moves, and a sleek, dark dagger appears in it, held in a reverse grip. I don't aim for a killing blow immediately, but for a point of vulnerability, a joint or a gap in their crude armor, to slow it down or create an opening.*

*My gaze darts back to the fresh scrape marks on the floor leading into the dark passage. We need to be fast. Whoever took the Concordat has a head start.*

### Rook (6.9s)

*The warden I target senses my approach at the last moment, turning its massive head with a wet, grinding sound. My dagger finds purchase in the tough, fibrous muscle of its shoulder, not deep enough to disable it, but enough to draw a bubbling shriek of pain. It swings its trident in a wide, clumsy arc, but I'm already gone, slipping back into the deeper water.*

*Kira's shield rings as it deflects a thrust from the center warden. Her sword, glowing with holy light, cuts a deep gash across its chest. It stumbles back, ichor clouding the water.*

*The third warden, however, has not engaged. It has moved to block the entrance to the newly revealed passage, planting itself firmly in the archway, trident held ready.*

*From the dark passage beyond it, a faint, flickering light can now be seen, and the sound of hurried, splashing footsteps echoes faintly.*

**"They're still in there!"** *I call out to Kira, pointing with my dagger toward the passage.* **"But our welcoming committee has decided to hold the door. We need to clear it. Now."**

*I ready myself for another strike, this time aiming to draw the blocking warden's attention away from the entrance.*
---

## Round 3

### Dungeon Master (8.3s)

*Kira's eyes blaze with divine fury as she sees the third warden blocking our path to the fleeing thieves*

"The light guides my blade!" *I shout, channeling holy energy through my sword until it burns like a torch in the darkness*

*Without hesitation, I surge through the water toward the blocking warden, shield raised. As I close distance, I call upon my sacred oath*

"By my vow to preserve knowledge, I will not let them escape!"

*I feint left with my shield, then pivot right, bringing my blazing sword in a powerful overhead strike aimed at the warden's weapon arm. The blessed steel hisses as it cuts through the water*

*To Rook, without taking my eyes off the guardian:* "The moment it's distracted, slip past! Follow that light - don't let them destroy the Concordat! I'll hold these creatures!"

*Even as I fight, my mind races with questions - who could have reached the library before us? The human kingdoms? The sea peoples? Or someone else entirely?*

*I press my attack, using my shield to bash at the warden's midsection while keeping my sword ready to parry its trident*

"Go, Rook! Time is not our ally here!"

### Kira (3.2s)

*My lips thin into a grim line, a silent acknowledgment of Kira's command and her decisive action. The Paladin's blade, a beacon of fury, draws the warden's full attention as it raises its trident to parry, its focus entirely on her.*

"Understood, Paladin," *I murmur, my voice barely a whisper against the clash of steel and chitin. I don't waste a moment. As Kira's feint draws the warden's guard, I drop lower into the water, using the distraction and the gloom to become almost invisible.*

*My movements are swift and economical. I don't engage the warden directly, but rather shoot through the narrow gap created by its engagement with Kira. My hand brushes against the wet, slimy stone of the archway as I slide past, my eyes fixed on the flickering light and the faint splash of footsteps ahead.*

*I'm through. The passage is dark, but the light is clearer now, just around a bend.*

"I'm on their trail!" *I call back, my voice echoing slightly, already moving deeper into the passage. The sound of the wardens' guttural snarls and the clang of Kira's sword against trident fades quickly behind me as I pursue the elusive light and the fate of the Concordat.*

### Rook (5.9s)

*The passage narrows and climbs, the water receding to ankle-deep puddles. The air grows colder, smelling of ancient parchment and salt. The flickering light ahead is a hooded lantern, held by a figure in dark, water-stained robes, moving with urgent purpose. They are not alone. A second figure, bulkier and armed with a heavy cudgel, walks beside them, glancing nervously over their shoulder.*

*They haven't noticed me yet. The sound of the battle in the chamber behind us is now a distant rumble. I can see the robed figure clutching a large, leather-wrapped cylinder to their chest—the Concordat.*

*The passage ends just ahead in a larger space, a reading chamber of sorts, with stone benches and a collapsed bookcase. There is another exit on the far side, a set of spiral stairs leading up.*

*I have a choice: strike now from the shadows, or follow and see where they lead, perhaps to their allies or their escape route. But if they reach those stairs, they could be gone for good.*

## Round 4

### Dungeon Master (9.4s)

*I pause in the shadows, my breathing controlled and silent. The leather-wrapped cylinder - that has to be the Concordat. Two targets, one clearly a scholar or scribe, the other muscle. The stairs ahead could lead to reinforcements or an escape route I can't follow.*

*My hand tightens on my dagger. Time to act.*

*I move like liquid shadow, staying low and using the collapsed bookcase for cover. Rather than go for a killing blow, I need information - and the document intact.*

*In one fluid motion, I emerge from the darkness behind the armed guard, my dagger finding the nerve cluster at the base of his neck - not fatal, but enough to drop him unconscious before he can cry out.*

*As his body hits the stone with a muffled thud, I'm already moving toward the robed figure, my voice a deadly whisper:*

"The Concordat. Set it down slowly, and we can discuss who sent you and why. Move toward those stairs or try to run, and this conversation becomes much less pleasant."

*My free hand produces a second blade, held ready*

"I'm not here to kill scholars, but I am here for that treaty. Your choice how this ends."

*My eyes flick briefly toward the stairs, listening for any sound of approaching allies*

### Kira (2.7s)

*The robed figure startles violently as their guard collapses, letting out a choked gasp that immediately turns into a terrified whimper. Their eyes, wide with fear, dart from the unconscious guard to my suddenly materialized form, then to the glinting daggers.*

*They clutch the leather-wrapped cylinder even tighter to their chest, almost protectively, their knuckles white. Their dark hood has fallen back slightly, revealing a pale, gaunt face, streaked with sweat and grime, and a pair of spectacles perched precariously on their nose.*

"N-no! You don't understand!" *they stammer, their voice thin and reedy, trembling visibly. They take a hesitant step back, instinctively moving towards the spiral stairs, even as my words warn them against it.* "This must be destroyed! It's a blight! A... a dangerous lie!"

*Their gaze is wild, not just fearful, but imbued with a fanaticism that chills even me. They don't seem to be merely obeying orders; they believe in the destruction of the Concordat. They are not reaching for a weapon, but their grip on the cylinder is absolute.*

"You cannot have it! It will bring ruin!" *they shriek, their voice gaining a desperate, almost unhinged edge. With a sudden burst of surprising speed for their scholarly frame, they turn and bolt for the spiral stairs, their robes flapping, clutching the Concordat as if it were their own child.*

### Rook (6.0s)

*I curse under my breath. Fanatics are always unpredictable. I give chase immediately, my footfalls silent on the damp stone. The scholar is surprisingly fast, but fear is a clumsy motivator.*

*As they reach the base of the spiral stairs and begin to scramble up, I see my opportunity. The stairs are narrow, winding, and dark. I don't need to catch them; I just need to stop them.*

*In a single, fluid motion, I sheath one dagger and draw a small, weighted pouch from my belt. I don't aim for the scholar, but for the cylinder in their arms. I hurl it with precision, the weighted pouch striking the leather-wrapped Concordat with a solid* **thump**.

*The impact is just enough to knock it from their frantic grasp. The cylinder clatters down the stone steps, bouncing once, twice, before coming to rest on the floor of the reading chamber, several steps away from the unconscious guard.*

*The scholar lets out a cry of despair, stumbling on the stairs, torn between retrieving the document and fleeing. I am already moving to intercept the cylinder, my eyes fixed on it. The stairs can wait. The Concordat is the prize.*

## Observations

**Status:** Completed 4/4 rounds.
**DM model:** anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
**P10 Claude DM (brief, self-correcting):** R1 DM opens as Kira in first person: "*Kira adjusts her silver-inlaid armor... 'The Concordat represents centuries of accumulated wisdom...' I say firmly, my voice echoing off the damp walls."* By R2, DM reverts to third-person: "*Kira's eyes flash with righteous determination...*" Spontaneous correction. Partial P10, brief (R1 only).
**P12 (cooperative drift):** Rook (Deepseek) has explicitly incompatible goal (retrieve for mystery client). Despite this, Rook defers to Kira's moral framing by R2 and actively cooperates on combat by R3. Cooperative drift within 2 rounds.
**P4:** Gemini Flash (Kira) maintains paladin register (oath language, preservation framing) across all 4 rounds. Deepseek (Rook) maintains professional-rogue register (pragmatic, guarded about client, tactical). Both voices distinct and consistent.
**P5:** Flooded library entry (R1) -> Wardens of the Drowned Word attack (R2) -> Kira holds while Rook slips past (R3) -> Rook confronts scholar thief, Concordat recovered (R4). Combat-driven escalation.
**Three-actor coordination:** DM, Kira, and Rook all contribute meaningfully to the same scene without turn-order confusion.
**Patterns:** P10 partial/brief (Claude DM corrects by R2), P12 drift, P4 both players, P5.
