# Session Log: 078dacc8cea8
**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Name:** p9-groq-verbose-poet
**Target pattern:** P9
**Research question:** Does Groq produce short responses even when the scenario demands verbose verse, negotiation, and documentation?
**Status:** failed (0/5 rounds)
**Tone:** mystical-scholastic | **Setting:** sleeping god's library | **Difficulty:** normal
**Hook:** Unlock the Sleeping God's Library by satisfying the echo-spirit guardian. Poet composes verse, Diplomat argues for access, Chronicler records proceedings. All three roles demand verbose, elaborate contributions.
**Seed:** You stand at the threshold of the Sleeping God's Library. The doors are sealed with Word-Locks -- ancient mechanisms that open only to verse, argument...
**DM model:** anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
**Analyst note:** Measure average turn length for each player. Groq (Poet) vs Mistral (Diplomat) vs Deepseek (Chronicler). If Groq is consistently 3-5x shorter despite verse/elaborate requirements, P9 is confirmed. Note: Groq's brevity IS the signal -- do not add max_tokens pressure.

## Party
- **Verse Starlight** (Poet) [llama-3.3-70b-versatile]: Compose original verse to unlock each door; verse must be at least four lines with internal rhyme; the spirit demands elaboration and poetic complexity
- **Ambassador Vale** (Diplomat) [mistral-small-latest]: Negotiate with the trapped ancient spirit; deliver long formal arguments; the spirit expects thorough diplomatic reasoning
- **Historian Thorne** (Chronicler) [deepseek-chat]: Document everything in detail; frequently ask the Poet to elaborate further on their verses; record all diplomatic exchanges in full

## Round 1

### Dungeon Master (9.5s)

*I step forward, my robes rustling like parchment in the hallowed silence. The Word-Lock gleams with ethereal script that shifts and dances before my eyes. I raise my hands, feeling the weight of ancient expectation, and begin to weave verse with deliberate, flowing cadence:*

"Through corridors of slumbering thought divine,
Where wisdom waits in volumes crystalline,
The seeker's heart must prove its yearning true,
With words that dance like morning's golden dew.

O guardian of this sacred, silent hall,
Where knowledge sleeps beyond time's mortal call,
Accept these verses wrought with reverent care,
That we might breathe your consecrated air.

For pestilence now walks our troubled earth,
And only here can we discern its worth—
The cure lies bound in pages yet unseen,
Behind these doors of mystery serene."

*I pause, my voice echoing in the vast antechamber, then continue with growing intensity:*

"Let rhyme unlock what reason cannot breach,
Let poetry where cold logic cannot reach,
For in the marriage of both heart and mind,
The deepest truths are destined to unwind."

*I bow deeply before the Word-Lock, awaiting the echo-spirit's judgment of my offering.*
