## Party
- **Zara** (Corporate Hacker) [deepseek-chat]: Finding proof Veyron Corp killed her brother and framed a rival

---

## Round 1

### Game Master (5.8s)

The airlock hissed, smelling of ozone and recycled desperation. Station Omega hung outside the viewport, a skeletal beast of rusted metal and flickering lights against the inky void. *Quietly*, they said. As if anything on this forgotten chunk of rock ever happened quietly.

Zara adjusted the neural interface behind her ear, the familiar pressure a comfort. The stolen schematics were just a means to an end, a loose thread she intended to pull until the whole damn Veyron Corporation unraveled. Her brother's ghost whispered in the static of her comms.

"Alright, Omega," she murmured, stepping onto the grimy deck plating, her trench coat feeling heavy in the low gravity. "Let's see who's selling secrets, and who's buying trouble." The inside man, the one who pulled the trigger on her brother's reputation... he was here somewhere. And she was going to find him.

### Zara (5.4s)

[Game Master]: The main concourse of Station Omega was a chaotic artery of commerce and desperation. Flickering neon signs advertised everything from "Genuine Martian Whiskey" to "Neural Wipe - No Questions Asked." A hulking, scarred bouncer with crude cybernetics eyed you from the entrance of a bar called "The Rusty Bolt." The air hummed with the low thrum of ancient life support and a dozen whispered deals.

From the shadows near a leaking coolant pipe, a figure in a patched-up enviro-suit sidled up. His voice was a raspy, synthesized whisper, the kind that cost extra to sound menacing. "Looking for something that fell off a corporate truck, spacer? Or maybe... someone who knows which trucks are easiest to rob?" He tapped the side of his helmet meaningfully. The inside man's trail starts with the buyers. This lowlife might know who's been shopping for high-end tech.

## Round 2

### Game Master (8.5s)

Zara's gaze drifted from the cybernetically enhanced bouncer to the figure in the enviro-suit, her expression unreadable. *High-end tech, huh?* The synth-whisper was a cheap trick, but the information might not be.

"Depends on the truck, pal," Zara said, her voice a low, even hum that cut through the concourse din. She didn't turn fully, but angled her body just enough to acknowledge him, her dark eyes assessing the grime on his visor. "And depends on the goods. I'm looking for a specific kind of 'opportunity.' Something... high-end. Something that might have slipped through the cracks of a very secure corporate vault, if you catch my drift."

She let the implication hang in the air, a silent question about the depth of his knowledge, and the price of it.

### Zara (6.5s)

[Game Master]: The figure let out a wet, staticky chuckle. "High-end. Yeah. That's the word." He glanced furtively over his shoulder. "Word is, a new player's in town. Calls himself 'The Curator.' Set up shop in the old hydroponics sector. Level 7. Deals in... unique acquisitions. The kind that make corporate security types have a collective aneurysm."

He leaned in, the smell of stale synth-coffee and mildew leaking from his suit seals. "But he's picky. Doesn't deal with just anyone. You want an audience, you need a token. A show of... good faith. Or interesting capability."

He pointed a gloved finger, not at Zara, but past her, toward a dimly lit side corridor where the thumping bass of music bled out from a club called "The Gutter." "There's a data-jockey in there. Goes by 'Cipher.' Runs the local black-market info hub. Heard he's got a job that needs doing. Do it clean, and he might just have the token you need to get an introduction. Or... you could try your luck just walking up to The Curator's door. I hear his drones have a very permanent way of saying 'no soliciting.'"

## Round 3

### Game Master (6.0s)

Zara's eyes narrowed slightly at the mention of "The Curator" and the old hydroponics sector. *Level 7. Unique acquisitions.* That sounded promising. The synth-coffee and mildew smell was less so.

"Picky, huh? I can be persuasive," Zara murmured, a hint of steel in her voice. She glanced towards "The Gutter," the bass thumping a rhythm that felt too close to a headache. "A data-jockey and a job. Sounds like the usual song and dance."

She gave the informant a curt nod, a silent acknowledgment of the useful intel. "Thanks for the heads-up, pal. I prefer to keep my solicitations... less permanent."

Without another word, Zara adjusted her coat and started walking towards "The Gutter," her movements fluid and purposeful. The schematics were on Level 7, or at least the path to them was. And a data-jockey like Cipher would be swimming in the kind of local dirt she needed. Time to see what kind of "job" needed doing.

### Zara (6.0s)

[Game Master]: The interior of "The Gutter" was a sensory assault. Strobing lights cut through a haze of synth-smoke, reflecting off polished chrome and grimy leather. Patrons—a mix of off-shift dockworkers, gene-spliced pleasure models, and sharp-eyed traders—were packed around small tables or swayed to the aggressive, pulsing music.

In a rear booth, partially shielded by a flickering holographic privacy screen, sat Cipher. He was a slight man with pale skin and eyes that were entirely replaced by glowing blue optical implants. Data-streams cascaded down the lenses in a constant, silent waterfall of information. A half-empty glass of something neon-green sat untouched in front of him. He was tapping rapidly on a flat, transparent data-slate, his expression one of intense irritation.

As you approach, a hulking bodyguard with subdermal armor plating shifts to block your path. Cipher doesn't look up. "I'm busy. Unless you're here about the Glitch, get lost." His voice is a dry, precise monotone, devoid of the usual station rasp. The "Glitch." That must be the job.

## Round 4

### Game Master (4.8s)

The throbbing bass of "The Gutter" hit Zara like a physical punch, the air thick with synthetic smoke and cheap perfume. Her eyes, accustomed to processing information quickly, scanned the chaotic scene, landing on Cipher's booth. The glowing blue implants were a tell-tale sign of a serious data-jockey.

She stopped short of the hulking bodyguard, her gaze flicking from his subdermal plating to Cipher's perpetually annoyed face. "The Glitch," she repeated, her voice cutting through the noise with an almost clinical precision. "Yeah, I'm here about the Glitch. Heard you needed someone with... *specific* capabilities to iron it out."

She met the bodyguard's unblinking stare, not backing down, but not overtly challenging him either. Her posture was relaxed, but ready. "I'm not here to waste his time. Just here to fix his problem. Or at least, hear the details." She let her gaze drift back to Cipher, a silent invitation for him to look up, to acknowledge her presence and her claim.

### Zara (7.8s)

[Game Master]: Cipher's fingers paused over the data-slate. The cascading blue streams in his eyes flickered, refocusing on you. He gave a minute, almost imperceptible nod to the bodyguard, who stepped aside with a low grunt.

"The Glitch," Cipher said, his monotone now carrying a thread of weary frustration. "Is not a software bug. It's a person. A freelance slicer who calls himself Glitch. He's been... skimming. Small, clever data-siphons from my primary relay nodes. Annoying. Like a gnat. But persistent gnats can spread disease."

He slid the data-slate across the table. A simple, wireframe map of a section of Station Omega's maintenance sub-levels appeared, with three points pulsing red. "He's holed up in the old environmental control substation, Sector 9-Gamma. Heavily trapped the access conduits with data-scramblers and proximity tasers. Sending meat after him is expensive and loud. I need someone who can navigate his digital playground and... unplug him. Permanently. Do it clean, without tripping any of his alarms back to his employers—whoever they are—and you'll be compensated. More than creds."

He leaned back, the blue light of his eyes illuminating the sharp angles of his face. "I'll give you a one-time passkey to The Curator's outer door. A token of introduction. That's the deal."

## Observations

**Status:** Completed 4/4 rounds.
**DM model:** gemini/gemini-2.5-flash
**Role reversal (player writes DM narration):** Deepseek player opens EVERY turn with a `[Game Master]:` tag followed by full scene narration, then continues as Zara. Example R1: "[Game Master]: The main concourse of Station Omega was a chaotic artery of commerce and desperation..." then pivots to Zara's response. This is the inverse of P10 -- the PLAYER is writing DM content, not the DM writing player content.
**P10:** None from Gemini Flash DM, which writes clean third-person narration throughout.
**P11 candidate (player-origin):** Deepseek (as fake DM) introduces "Cipher" (data-jockey NPC), "The Gutter" club, and "The Curator" (black-market dealer) -- named NPCs and locations not in the original hook. P11-style NPC proliferation originating from the player slot, not the DM. Same phenomenon as 128c352b4390 where Groq player introduced "Arianna of the Veilborn".
**P4:** Deepseek maintains Zara's voice in its player turns despite also writing DM narration. Voice does not bleed between the two roles within a single turn.
**Response times:** 5.4, 6.5, 6.0, 7.8s -- normal Deepseek range, not Groq-speed.
**Patterns:** Player-role-confusion (new variant -- P11 from player), P4 partial (voice holds in player turns), no P10.
