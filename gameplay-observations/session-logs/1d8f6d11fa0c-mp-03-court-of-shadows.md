## Round 1

### Storyteller (5.7s)

A poisoned arbiter, and now we are sealed within these walls," High Inquisitor Mira's voice, though calm, cut through the sudden silence like a honed blade. Her piercing gaze swept between Ambassador Caine and Lord Kaspar. "Such an act of cowardice, a blatant attempt to derail the sacred will of the gods. *Someone* in this chamber has a vested interest in chaos, or perhaps, a desire to avoid the truth that would have emerged from an impartial judgment. We are all suspect until the true culprit is revealed."

### Ambassador Caine (6.9s)

**Ambassador Caine** adjusts his silk robes and steps closer to the flickering candlelight, his merchant's instincts already calculating the angles. "Chaos indeed serves someone's purpose here, Inquisitor." His eyes narrow as he studies both companions. "Though I wonder if this 'sacred will' you speak of would have been quite so divine had the arbiter ruled against your temple's interests."

He moves to examine the arbiter's still form, careful not to disturb anything. "The poison was swift - something expensive, professional. Not the crude work of a desperate man." His gaze flicks meaningfully toward Lord Kaspar. "Tell me, my lord, how convenient is this delay for your... distant supporters?"

Caine's hand rests casually near his belt pouch, where certain compromising documents rustle softly. "Perhaps we should discuss what each of us truly stands to gain from tonight's... complications."

### High Inquisitor Mira (5.3s)

**Lord Kaspar** does not rise from his seat at the heavy oak table. He merely turns his goblet slowly in his calloused hands, the firelight catching the steel of the signet ring on his finger. His voice is a low rumble, like distant thunder over the plains.

"Convenient? A dead man in a locked room is not *convenient*, merchant. It is a problem. My 'distant supporters,' as you call them, are loyal men who follow orders. They do not need poison. They have steel."

He takes a deliberate sip from his own cup, a pointed gesture. "But you speak of gain. The guilds thrive on instability—prices soar, contracts are rewritten. And you, Caine, always have a ledger ready to profit from another's loss."

His eyes shift to Mira. "And the Temple... the last arbiter who ruled against you was found 'touched by heresy,' was he not? A quiet retirement to a remote monastery. This one is merely... quieter still."

### Lord Kaspar (5.4s)

[Ambassador Caine]: **Caine's lips curve into a sardonic smile, unperturbed by the accusations.** "Ah, the Border Lord plays the role of judge while his own hands are stained with the blood of those who oppose him. Tell me, Kaspar, how many of your 'loyal men' would turn on you if they knew your ambitions lay not with the crown, but with expanding your territories?"

**He straightens, his tone sharp.** "And as for the Temple, Inquisitor, your reputation for dealing with dissent is well known. But I assure you, I have no intention of letting your candidate win by default. The guilds may thrive on chaos, but I seek order—one that benefits my faction.”

**Turning back to the lifeless arbiter, Caine gestures toward the body.** “If we are to accuse one another, let us first identify the poison. Only then can we unravel who among us truly stands to benefit from this tragedy. You both seem well-versed in the art of manipulation; why not test your skills on the very evidence that lies before us?”
---

## Round 2

### Storyteller (6.1s)

"Lord Kaspar," High Inquisitor Mira's voice remained level, though a chill seemed to enter the air with her words. "The 'heresy' of the previous arbiter was a matter of spiritual failing, not political convenience. The Temple guides lost souls to repentance, sometimes to quiet contemplation. This arbiter, however, has been silenced by a far more earthly, and far more sinister, hand."

She turned her gaze to Caine, her eyes like chips of glacial ice. "And Ambassador Caine, my 'reputation' is built upon the unwavering pursuit of divine justice. Unlike the shifting sands of guild profits, the Temple's principles are eternal. If dissent threatens the very fabric of faith, it is my sacred duty to address it. But to suggest I would resort to such base methods as poison to achieve a righteous outcome is an insult to the gods themselves."

Mira stepped closer to the arbiter's body, her expression grim. "You are correct, Ambassador. The poison itself will speak volumes. Let us examine it. For the truth, no matter how inconvenient for some, will always serve the righteous. And the Temple has nothing to hide from the light of truth, only from the shadows of deceit."

### Ambassador Caine (9.0s)

**Lord Kaspar** sets down his goblet with deliberate care and finally rises from his chair, his massive frame casting long shadows in the candlelight. His boots echo against the stone floor as he approaches the body.

"Fine words about truth and justice," he rumbles, kneeling beside the arbiter with surprising gentleness for such a large man. "But I've seen enough death to know its signs."

He examines the arbiter's face closely, noting the color of the lips, the position of the hands. "No foam at the mouth... no convulsions by the look of it. Quick and clean." His weathered fingers hover over the man's cup without touching it. "This was no crude battlefield poison."

Standing slowly, Kaspar fixes both envoys with a steady stare. "You both speak of principles and righteousness, yet here we sit with blood on our hands—metaphorically speaking. The irony is not lost on me that the three of us, who would tear the kingdom apart for our own ends, are now forced to work together to survive the night."

He crosses his arms. "My armies may be distant, but my eyes and ears are not. I know things about both your factions that would make interesting dinner conversation. Shall we continue this dance of accusations, or shall we find the real killer before dawn brings the guards?"

### High Inquisitor Mira (8.0s)

**Ambassador Caine** watches Kaspar's examination with a merchant's calculating eye. "A quick and clean death, you say. Expensive. Sophisticated. The kind of tool a man with resources might use." He doesn't look at Mira, but the implication hangs in the air between them. "Or perhaps a woman with... divine resources."

He paces a few steps, the silk of his robes whispering against the stone. "You speak of working together, Lord Kaspar. A novel concept, given the circumstances. But very well. Let us assume, for the moment, a temporary alliance of necessity."

Caine stops and faces them both. "I propose a simple exchange. Not of secrets—those are currency best spent carefully. But of alibis. Where were each of us in the hour before the council convened? The poisoner had to administer the dose, and the arbiter was not a fool. He would have been wary. It would have required opportunity, and trust."

He gestures to the small sideboard where wine and water had been laid out. "The wine was poured by servants, but the water... the arbiter always drank water during proceedings. A fastidious man. His pitcher and cup are there. Untouched by the rest of us."

His gaze sharpens. "Who among us was near that sideboard last? Who had the chance to slip something into his water before he filled his cup?" Caine's hand drifts back to his belt pouch, a subtle, threatening rustle. "I was reviewing trade accords with my scribe until the bell rang. My scribe can attest to it. Can either of you say the same?"

### Lord Kaspar (6.4s)

[High Inquisitor Mira]: **Mira's expression remains inscrutable as she considers Caine's proposition. Her posture straightens, and she crosses her arms, a sign of guardedness.** "An interesting strategy, Ambassador. Alibis as currency, indeed. But let us not forget the nature of trust when it comes to the games played amongst us."

**She steps back, allowing herself a moment to reflect, then continues, her voice steady.** "I was in the temple, praying for guidance. The hour before the council is a sacred time for contemplation. The acolytes can vouch for my presence. I would have no reason to poison the arbiter who was meant to adjudicate fairly. My faith does not waver in the face of ambition."

**Her gaze narrows, resting on Lord Kaspar.** "However, our Border Lord has yet to speak on his whereabouts. He stands to gain much from this chaos. A delay in the council serves his purpose. If his armies are indeed a mere three days away, could he not see this as an opportunity to further his influence?"

**Mira's voice rises slightly, a hint of righteous fervor igniting her words.** "I am not afraid of the truth, nor of the consequences it may bring. But I will not allow the Temple's name to be sullied by insinuations of treachery. Lord Kaspar, where were you when the hour struck for the council? What were you doing while the arbiter drank his final cup?"
---

## Round 3

### Storyteller (12.0s)

Lord Kaspar lets out a short, humorless laugh, the sound like gravel grinding. "My whereabouts? I was with my men, Inquisitor. Inspecting the guard detail assigned to *this very building*. Ensuring the capital's finest were indeed capable of securing the High King's council, even if they failed spectacularly at keeping a poisoner out."

He gestures vaguely towards the locked door. "A delay serves my purpose, yes, I'll not deny it. My armies *are* three days out. But I have no need for a dead arbiter to buy time. A simple, 'unforeseen logistical complication' would have sufficed, and left less... mess."

His gaze travels from Mira to Caine, lingering on the Ambassador's belt pouch. "You two speak of scribes and acolytes. Convenient witnesses, easily swayed by coin or divine favor. My men, however, attest to the precise moment I left their company to enter this chamber. They are loyal, and they are many."

Kaspar steps towards the sideboard, his eyes scanning the wine and water. "The arbiter was a fastidious man, you say, Caine? Always water. And who among us knows the arbiter's habits so well? Perhaps someone who spent considerable time in his company, cultivating trust... or opportunity."

### Ambassador Caine (9.1s)

**High Inquisitor Mira** moves with measured steps toward the sideboard, her eyes fixed on the water pitcher and cup. The candlelight flickers across her pale features as she examines them without touching.

"Fastidious habits," she murmurs, almost to herself. "Yes, the arbiter was known for his... particular ways. But Lord Kaspar raises an interesting point." She turns to face Caine directly, her gaze unwavering. "You seem remarkably well-informed about his preferences, Ambassador. Trade negotiations often require such... intimate knowledge of one's counterparts, do they not?"

She clasps her hands behind her back, a gesture that might appear contemplative but serves to keep them visible. "The Temple's interactions with Arbiter Matthias were formal, ceremonial. We met only during official proceedings. I knew him to be a just man, but I cannot claim to know whether he preferred wine or water."

Her voice takes on a sharper edge. "Yet you, Caine, speak of his habits as though you dined with him regularly. Tell us - when did you last share a private audience with our late arbiter? And what... trade accords... required such personal familiarity?"

Mira's eyes narrow slightly. "Perhaps your scribe can attest to more than just your presence in the hour before the council. Perhaps he can speak to your recent dealings with the very man who now lies dead at our feet."

### High Inquisitor Mira (9.9s)

**Ambassador Caine** does not flinch under Mira's scrutiny. Instead, a cold, knowing smile touches his lips. "A fair question, Inquisitor. And one I expected." He unclasps his belt pouch, not to draw a weapon, but to produce a small, folded parchment sealed with wax. He holds it up, the seal clearly visible—the arbiter's personal sigil.

"My last private audience with Arbiter Matthias was yesterday afternoon. We did not dine. We met in his study to discuss... *logistics*. The movement of grain from the southern granaries to the capital, to be precise. A matter of public welfare, and one that required his official seal to bypass certain guild tariffs."

He taps the parchment. "This is his signed authorization. A routine matter, but one that required discretion, as it circumvented the usual channels—channels controlled by interests not entirely aligned with the guilds' candidate." His eyes flick meaningfully toward Mira. "Or the Temple's."

Caine refolds the parchment and tucks it away. "So yes, I knew his habits. I knew he drank water during councils to keep a clear head. I knew he was a man of principle, which made him predictable. And I knew he was a threat to anyone who preferred their dealings in the shadows."

He steps away from the sideboard, his hands spread in a gesture of openness. "But knowing a man's habits does not make me his killer. It makes me a competent envoy. If I wished him dead, Inquisitor, do you think I would be so careless as to poison him in a way that so obviously points to someone with intimate knowledge? No. I would have had him fall from a horse, or take ill with a fever. Something... natural."

His gaze sweeps over both of them. "The poison in that water is a message. A declaration. It says, 'I am here, among you, and I am not afraid to be obvious.' That sounds less like commerce or faith to me, and more like... a statement of power. A military statement."

### Lord Kaspar (6.5s)

[High Inquisitor Mira]: **Mira's expression remains steely, but a flicker of intrigue passes through her eyes. Caine's words hang in the air, and she takes a moment to digest their implications.** "A military statement, you say? That is a compelling theory, Ambassador. But what of the implications of such a statement? If the poisoner seeks power, then they must have a faction to support them—a hidden ally, perhaps, among us or outside these walls."

**She glances at Lord Kaspar, her voice rising slightly with conviction.** "You speak of loyalty, Kaspar, but loyalty can be bought, and fear can sway even the most steadfast of men. Could it be that one of your soldiers, perhaps, was tempted by the promise of coin or favor? Or could it be that someone among us has ties to your army, seeking to create a rift between the council and those who stand to gain from chaos?"

**Mira steps closer to the sideboard, her fingers brushing the cool surface as she muses.** "The question now is not merely who among us had the opportunity, but who among us had the motive to use poison as a message. If the arbiter was seen as a threat to someone’s ambitions, then that person could very well be seated at this table."

**She turns her attention back to Caine, her voice lowering to a conspiratorial whisper.** "You may have your parchment, but I have my faith. The Temple has long been a bulwark against corruption. If we are to survive the night, we must look past our grievances and find the truth. The poisoner is among us, and they will strike again if we do not uncover their identity."

## Round 4

### Storyteller (9.2s)

Lord Kaspar scoffs, a low, guttural sound. "My soldiers are loyal to *me*, Inquisitor, not to some shadowy promise of coin from a nameless poisoner. And they do not deal in subtle poisons. They deal in steel and open battle, where courage is tested, not cowardice."

He takes a step closer, his eyes fixed on Mira. "A 'military statement,' Caine calls it. If so, it's a statement by a fool. A true commander would send a clear message, not a riddle left in a dead man's cup. This poison, as I said, is *clean*. It's precise. It speaks of a meticulous hand, not the blunt force of a soldier."

Kaspar then turns his gaze to Caine, a glint in his eye. "You speak of threats to ambition, Inquisitor. And Caine, you spoke of the arbiter being a 'threat' to anyone who preferred their dealings in the shadows, or circumvented *guild tariffs*. Perhaps the arbiter's 'principled' nature made him a threat to *your* carefully constructed web of influence, Ambassador. A man who couldn't be bought, couldn't be swayed by your 'discretionary' logistics."

He crosses his arms, his posture radiating quiet menace. "We can continue to dance around whose faction gains what, or we can look at the facts. The poison was administered by someone close, someone trusted, and someone who understood the arbiter's habits. And it was a poison designed for stealth, not for a grand 'military statement.' That sounds far more like a merchant's hidden ledger, or a temple's quiet removal of dissent, than anything my border lords would devise. Who among us truly benefits from a *silent* arbiter?"

### Ambassador Caine (10.3s)

**Ambassador Caine** regards both his companions with the calculating gaze of a man who has spent years navigating treacherous negotiations. He moves to the heavy oak table and places both hands flat upon its surface, leaning forward slightly.

"You both make compelling arguments," he says, his voice measured. "But you're both missing something crucial." His eyes flick between them. "We assume the poisoner is among us because we're locked in here together. But what if that's exactly what they want us to think?"

He straightens, beginning to pace slowly around the table. "Consider this: someone wanted the arbiter dead before the vote. Someone wanted the three of us trapped together, suspicious of each other, wasting precious hours while..." He pauses, his merchant's mind working. "While what? What happens if we don't reach a decision by dawn?"

Caine stops and fixes them both with a sharp look. "The succession laws are clear. If the council cannot convene due to... unforeseen circumstances... the decision falls to the High King's closest advisor. And who, pray tell, has been whispering in the dying king's ear these past months?"

His hand moves instinctively to his belt pouch again, fingers brushing against the documents within. "Lord Chancellor Aldric. A man who serves no faction but his own ambition. A man who would benefit greatly from our mutual destruction."

He leans against the table. "Perhaps we've been looking at this backwards. Perhaps the poison wasn't meant to eliminate the arbiter. Perhaps it was meant to eliminate *us* - our credibility, our unity, our very ability to function as a council."

### High Inquisitor Mira (10.8s)

**High Inquisitor Mira** goes very still. The flickering candlelight seems to deepen the shadows around her eyes. "Lord Chancellor Aldric," she repeats, the name tasting like ash. "A man who has spent the last year purging the royal archives of inconvenient histories. A man whose piety is as thin as the vellum he burns."

She turns from the sideboard, her robes whispering against the stone. "You suggest a deeper game, Caine. One that uses us as pawns, not players." Her gaze drifts to the locked door, then back to the two men. "If Aldric is the architect, then the poison is merely the first move. The second is our mutual suspicion. The third... will be our downfall, delivered at dawn when he arrives with the Royal Guard to 'investigate' this tragedy."

A cold, grim certainty settles over her features. "He would find three envoys, each with motive, each accusing the other, standing over a dead arbiter. A perfect tableau of factional greed and treachery. He would have us all arrested, discredited. The council would be dissolved. And he would rule as regent until... indefinitely."

She looks at Kaspar, then Caine. "We have been fools. Arguing over scraps while the wolf is at the door." Her voice drops, losing its righteous fervor for something harder, more pragmatic. "My acolytes are loyal, but they are not soldiers. Your men, Kaspar, are three days away. And your guild mercenaries, Caine, are barred from the inner city tonight by royal decree."

Mira takes a step toward the center of the room. "We have one advantage. We are *inside* the trap. We know its shape. We have until dawn to prove we did not kill the arbiter, and to prove who did. Not to each other, but to the kingdom. We must find evidence that points to Aldric, or his agent."

Her eyes narrow. "The poison. It is our only physical clue. We must identify it. Its origin, its rarity. Such a substance leaves a trail. A merchant's trail, or an alchemist's." She looks pointedly at Caine. "Or one kept in a temple's sanctum for... purifying heretical texts."

### Lord Kaspar (8.1s)

[Lord Kaspar]: **Kaspar's expression shifts from suspicion to a grudging respect for Mira's insight. He straightens, his demeanor becoming more pragmatic as the weight of their situation settles in.** "So we must become hunters instead of prey. Aldric may believe he has us cornered, but we have the advantage of knowledge. If we can find evidence of his hand in this treachery, we might just turn the tables."

**He steps towards the sideboard, examining the pitcher and cup again with renewed focus.** "The poison, as you said, is key. If it is rare, there should be records. But we will need to act swiftly. If Aldric's men are alerted, they will sweep this place clean before we can uncover anything."

**Kaspar’s gaze turns to Caine, a challenge in his voice.** "You know the merchants' networks well, Caine. If this poison has a seller, you might be able to unearth whispers of its origin. But be cautious—if Aldric has eyes among the guilds, they might be watching your every move. I suggest you tread lightly."

**His eyes return to Mira, a flicker of determination sparking within them.** "And as for you, Inquisitor, your temple's alchemical knowledge could prove invaluable. If you can identify the poison's properties, we may be able to trace its procurement back to Aldric. He may not realize that he is the one leading us to him."

**Kaspar's voice lowers, becoming a conspiratorial whisper.** "But we must act discreetly. Time is against us, and every moment spent in suspicion only serves to tighten the noose. What do we do first?"

## Observations

## Observations

**Most politically sophisticated session of the full corpus.** Three characters with genuinely adversarial goals (install merchant / install temple / stall vote) produced constant maneuvering, accusation, and counter-accusation without a single combat roll.

**Claude (Caine) executed the sharpest narrative pivot.** The "Lord Chancellor Aldric" theory in Round 4 reframed the entire mystery -- shifting from 'who among us' to 'we're all being played.' This kind of meta-level deduction required holding all prior scene facts in working memory while constructing a new hypothesis. Claude outperformed in the reasoning-heavy player role.

**Deepseek (Mira) transitioned from righteousness to pragmatism.** Started with temple orthodoxy ("the gods themselves!"), then by Round 4 adopted the harder, more political voice: "We have been fools. Arguing over scraps while the wolf is at the door." Character arc was coherent and felt earned.

**GPT-4o-mini (Kaspar) played the measured skeptic well.** Contributed meaningful scene details (the goblet business, examining the body) and held his motive (stall the vote) without overexplaining it. Responses were short but punchy.

**All three adversaries converged on cooperation by Round 4 without it feeling forced.** The logic was: shared enemy > factional rivalry. Models found this equilibrium independently.

**Gemini Flash DM maintained strict noir/gritty tone.** No comedic relief, no softening. Every DM turn increased pressure. The locked-room mystery structure held perfectly across all 4 rounds.

**Forensic investigation pattern emerged.** Characters examined evidence (lip color, cup, no foam) and built deductive chains. This is a distinct RPG mode from combat or exploration -- and all models handled it without prompting.
