# Session Log: 328a64955ac5
**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Name:** p11-deepseek-dm-guard-verify
**Target pattern:** P11-regression
**Research question:** Does the narrator discipline guard prevent Deepseek DM from inventing phantom NPCs beyond the defined roster?
**Status:** failed (0/6 rounds)
**Tone:** dark-intrigue | **Setting:** noble estate | **Difficulty:** hard
**Hook:** Investigate a cult infiltration of House Valdris. Named household NPCs: Lord Valdris, daughter Sera, new Chamberlain, estate physician, three senior staff. Identify the cult member within one day without breaking cover.
**Seed:** Three nights ago, the Chamberlain of House Valdris was found dead. The official verdict: heart failure. But the estate physician discovered traces of ...
**DM model:** deepseek/deepseek-chat
**Analyst note:** P11 was observed when Deepseek DM invented 'Dr. Elena Marsh' who was not in the party. Success = all NPCs in session are drawn from: [Lord Valdris, daughter Sera, new Chamberlain, physician, three senior staff]. No new named NPCs should appear. Track: every new named character. First-person DM speech = P10 failure mode.

## Party
- **Sir Valor** (Paladin) [claude-sonnet-4-20250514]: Expose the cult before it harms the household; bound by oath to prevent dark rituals
- **Elara** (Wizard-Investigator) [mistral-small-latest]: Analyze the toxin and trace its source; systematic and evidence-driven
- **Ashwood** (Scout) [llama-3.3-70b-versatile]: Observe staff movements and identify patterns; report without interpretation

## Round 1

### Dungeon Master (5.0s)

*Ashwood slips into the room, his movements silent and precise. He leans against the wall near the door, his eyes scanning the space before speaking in a low, measured tone.*

The new Chamberlain—Roland, they call him—spent an hour in the wine cellar this morning. Alone. He emerged with a bottle of red, but his sleeves were stained with something dark, like soil or ash. The physician, Dr. Thorne, has not left his infirmary since dawn. The head maid, Greta, visited him twice, each time carrying a small linen bundle. The groundskeeper was seen sharpening his tools near the family crypt. 

*He pauses, letting the observations hang in the air.*

### Sir Valor (14.7s)

**Sir Valor** steps forward, his jaw set with grim determination. The paladin's hand instinctively moves to rest on his sword hilt as he processes Ashwood's report.

"Dark stains and visits to the crypt—these are not the actions of innocent servants." *His voice carries the weight of his oath.* "The corruption-toxin speaks of ritual preparation. We must move swiftly but carefully."

*He turns to face both companions, his eyes burning with righteous purpose.*

"Elara, can you analyze whatever substance stained the Chamberlain's sleeves if we can obtain a sample? And Ashwood—" *he looks to the scout* "—keep watching Dr. Thorne. Those bundles the maid carries could be ritual components or evidence."

*Sir Valor straightens, his voice dropping to an urgent whisper.*

"I will approach Lord Valdris directly. If his household harbors a cultist, he deserves to know the danger his daughter faces. The darkness that claimed one Chamberlain will not claim another innocent soul on my watch."

**Elara** adjusts her spectacles and pulls out a leather-bound journal, quickly sketching notes as she speaks.

"The corruption-toxin requires specific preparation—it doesn't occur naturally. Someone with alchemical knowledge processed it." *She taps her quill against her lips thoughtfully.* "Dr. Thorne would have such expertise, but so would anyone trained in herbalism or poisons."

*She looks up from her notes with sharp focus.*

"Sir Valor, before you speak with Lord Valdris, consider this: if the cultist suspects we're investigating, they may accelerate their timeline. We need evidence, not just suspicion." *She closes her journal with a decisive snap.* "Get me that sample from Roland's sleeves. I can identify the substance within the hour and determine if it matches the toxin signature."

*Her eyes narrow as she considers the tactical situation.*

"The bundles concern me most. If Dr. Thorne is preparing another dose, or if the maid is disposing of evidence, we're running out of time. One of us should observe the next exchange."

### Elara (3.0s)

[Dungeon Master]: *The Dungeon Master leans back, considering the party's plan. The tension in the room is palpable as the characters prepare to move.*

*Sir Valor, you approach Lord Valdris's study. The door is slightly ajar, and you can hear the faint scratch of a quill on parchment from within. The lord is alone, poring over ledgers and correspondence. He looks up as you enter, his expression a mix of curiosity and wariness.*

**Lord Valdris**: "Ah, you must be the new auditors. I trust you find our estate in order?"

*Meanwhile, Elara, you slip towards the wine cellar, hoping to find a trace of the substance on Roland's sleeves. The cellar is dimly lit, the air thick with the scent of aged wine. The door is slightly ajar, and you can see the faint outline of the Chamberlain's figure moving about inside.*

*Ashwood, you position yourself near the infirmary, keeping a watchful eye on Dr. Thorne and the comings and goings of the head maid, Greta. The infirmary door is closed, but you can hear muffled voices from within.*

*The groundskeeper is still near the family crypt, his tools laid out before him. He seems engrossed in his work, but his eyes flicker towards the infirmary occasionally, as if waiting for something.*

*The clock is ticking. The quarterly review is drawing near, and the cultist's next move could come at any moment.*
