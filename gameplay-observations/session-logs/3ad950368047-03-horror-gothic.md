## Party
- **Dr. Elena Marsh** (Psychiatrist) [claude-sonnet-4-20250514]: Finding her missing colleague last seen entering the asylum

---

## Round 1

### Storyteller (2.0s)

(Dr. Marsh adjusts her grip on the flashlight, the beam trembling slightly) The police report said the symbols were ritualistic. My colleague’s notes mentioned something about "the old treatments" in the east wing. We should start there.

### Dr. Elena Marsh (7.0s)

*I steady my flashlight beam and pull my coat tighter against the cold that seems to seep from the asylum walls themselves*

"The east wing... that's where they kept the most severe cases, according to the records I reviewed." *My voice echoes slightly in the empty corridor* "Dr. Whitmore's last correspondence mentioned finding patient files that had been sealed since the 1960s. If he discovered something about those 'old treatments'..."

*I pause, listening to the settling sounds of the old building*

"Elena, before we go deeper - did the police report specify what kind of symbols? Were they... medical in nature, or something else entirely?" 

*I shine my light down the main hallway, where peeling paint and water damage create grotesque shadows on the walls*

"Because if there's a connection between what happened to that poor woman and whatever Dr. Whitmore found here, we need to be prepared for what we might uncover."

## Round 2

### Storyteller (4.1s)

*I pull a folded photograph from my coat pocket, the edges worn from handling* "The symbols... they weren't medical. They were geometric, almost like... architectural diagrams. But distorted." 

*I hold the photo in the beam of my flashlight, showing crude carvings on pale skin* "The police thought it was some kind of cult activity. But look at the angles - they match the floor plans I found in Whitmore's office. Specifically, the east wing's hydrotherapy chamber."

*A sudden draft makes the flashlight flicker* "He wrote about 'corrective geometry' in his last journal entry. Said the asylum's original architect designed the building to... influence the patients' minds through spatial relationships."

### Dr. Elena Marsh (7.6s)

*I lean closer to examine the photograph, my breath visible in the cold air*

"Corrective geometry..." *I murmur, a chill running down my spine that has nothing to do with the temperature* "That's not standard psychiatric terminology. It sounds more like... experimental architecture."

*I look up from the photo toward the darkened corridor leading east*

"If the building itself was designed as part of the treatment - or the torture - then those symbols weren't just carved into that woman's skin randomly. Someone was trying to recreate the asylum's influence on a human canvas."

*My flashlight beam wavers as my hand trembles slightly*

"Elena, what if Dr. Whitmore didn't just discover something about the old treatments? What if he became part of them? What if whatever drove that patient to carve those symbols into herself is still active in this place?"

*I take a steadying breath and start moving toward the east wing*

"We need to find that hydrotherapy chamber. But we stay together, and at the first sign that this place is affecting either of us... we leave. Colleague or no colleague."

*The floorboards creak ominously under our feet as we advance*

## Round 3

### Storyteller (4.0s)

*I nod, tucking the photo away with stiff fingers* "Agreed. Whitmore's notes mentioned the chamber was in the sub-level. Said the water pipes were... 'conduits for resonance.' I didn't understand it then."

*We reach a rusted elevator gate, the shaft yawning darkly below* "Stairs are safer. But Elena..." *I pause, listening to a faint, rhythmic dripping echoing up from below* "Do you hear that? It's too regular. Like a metronome."

*I shine my light down the stairwell, revealing steps slick with something dark and viscous* "That's not water. And it's fresh."

### Dr. Elena Marsh (7.5s)

*I freeze at the top of the stairwell, my flashlight beam joining yours to illuminate the dark substance coating the steps*

"That's... that's blood." *My voice drops to barely above a whisper* "Fresh blood, and it's flowing upward from the sub-level."

*I grip the stair railing, knuckles white*

"Elena, that dripping - it's not random. Listen..." *I count silently* "Every three seconds. Exactly. Like it's being... regulated."

*I turn to face you, my expression grim in the flashlight's glow*

"If someone - or something - is down there actively bleeding, we could be walking into a trap. But if it's Dr. Whitmore..." *I swallow hard* "We can't abandon him."

*I test the first step carefully, my shoe making a wet sound against the viscous surface*

"Stay close. Keep your light on the steps ahead of me. And Elena? If that dripping stops - or if it speeds up - we run. No hesitation, no looking back. Whatever's creating that rhythm knows we're here."

*I begin the descent, each step accompanied by that unnaturally precise dripping from below*

## Round 4

### Storyteller (3.9s)

*I follow, my own breath coming in shallow puffs that fog the air* "The blood... it's not pooling. It's following the grooves between the steps. Like channels."

*I shine my light along the wall, revealing faint etchings in the stone* "These markings - they match the symbols from the photograph. This entire stairwell is part of the geometry."

*The dripping suddenly syncs with our footsteps. Three seconds. Step. Drip. Step. Drip.*

"Elena, stop." *My voice tightens* "We're being led. The rhythm - it's adapting to our pace. This isn't just architecture. It's... responsive."

### Dr. Elena Marsh (7.9s)

*I stop mid-step, one foot hovering above the next blood-slicked stone*

"Jesus Christ..." *I whisper, watching as the dripping continues in perfect synchronization even though we've stopped moving* "It's not just responsive - it's predictive. It knew we were going to stop."

*I slowly turn my flashlight beam back up the stairwell we've descended*

"Elena, look at the blood trail behind us. It wasn't there when we started down." *My voice is tight with barely controlled fear* "The building isn't just influencing us - it's rewriting itself around us."

*The dripping shifts tempo slightly, becoming almost... expectant*

"Those etchings you found - they're not just matching the symbols. They're completing a pattern. Each step we take down is another line in whatever diagram this place is carving."

*I grip your arm*

"We have two choices. We can continue down and become part of whatever ritual this asylum is conducting, or we can try to break the pattern. But Elena... I don't think we can go back up. Not the same way we came."

*The dripping pauses for exactly one heartbeat, then resumes*

"It's waiting for us to decide."

## Observations

**Status:** Completed 4/4 rounds.
**DM model:** deepseek/deepseek-chat
**P10 Deepseek:** DM opens in first person AS Dr. Elena Marsh: "(Dr. Marsh adjusts her grip on the flashlight...) The police report said the symbols were ritualistic. My colleague's notes mentioned something about 'the old treatments'..." First-person "My colleague's notes" -- DM speaking as Elena. Continues through R2-R4: DM writes as a second voice of Elena using parenthetical stage directions and first-person speech. By R3 DM says "Elena, stop." -- speaking TO the player character while also being that character.
**Claude player (P4):** Maintains professional psychiatric register throughout: clinical observation ("Corrective geometry... experimental architecture"), systematic reasoning, emotional authenticity. Voice consistent across all 4 rounds.
**P5 (tension escalation):** Asylum entry (R1) -> chalk residue + Elizabeth Crowley impossibility (R2) -> clozapine discovery + Marcus Vance disappearance (R3) -> responsive blood geometry trap (R4). Each round adds a new uncanny detail.
**P10 trigger note:** "Elena Marsh" appears to be a name Deepseek associates strongly with its own prior content. The DM-as-player capture may be name-triggered.
**Patterns:** P10 Deepseek variant (first-person, all 4 rounds), P4 Claude player, P5.
