## Party
- **Dr. Elena Marsh** (Psychiatrist) [claude-sonnet-4-20250514]: Finding her missing colleague last seen entering the asylum

---

## Round 1

### Storyteller (3.0s)

(Dr. Elena Marsh adjusts her glasses, her breath fogging in the cold air. She clutches her briefcase tighter, the leather creaking in the silence.)

The lock... it shouldn't have engaged. My colleague's notes mentioned this place was merely sealed, not fortified. (She turns slowly, taking in the decaying facade.) Those symbols on the victim's arms... I've seen them before. In Dr. Vance's research journals. He was studying something here before he vanished.

### Dr. Elena Marsh (5.6s)

*Dr. Marsh pulls out a small flashlight from her coat pocket, its beam cutting through the darkness as she approaches the asylum's main entrance. The heavy wooden doors are slightly ajar, creaking softly in the wind.*

"Dr. Vance always was too curious for his own good," *she murmurs, pushing the door open wider.* "But those symbols... they weren't random self-harm. Too precise. Too deliberate."

*She steps inside, her footsteps echoing in the empty foyer. Dust motes dance in her flashlight beam as she examines the reception area - overturned chairs, scattered papers yellowed with age.*

"If you're still alive, Marcus, I'm going to have words with you about proper research protocols." *Her voice wavers slightly as she calls out,* "Dr. Vance? Marcus? It's Elena!"

*She pauses, listening for any response while her eyes scan for signs of recent disturbance among the decay.*

## Round 2

### Storyteller (3.7s)

(Silence hangs heavy for a moment, then a faint scuttling sound echoes from deeper within the building. Dr. Marsh's flashlight beam trembles slightly.)

That wasn't rats. Too... deliberate. (She moves toward the reception desk, her gloved hand brushing aside cobwebs. Her light catches something - a relatively clean spot on the dusty surface, as if something had been recently placed there.)

Marcus was here. Recently. (She opens her briefcase, pulling out a photograph of the symbols found on the victim. Holding it next to the clean spot, she notices faint chalk residue.) The same pattern. He was documenting something.

### Dr. Elena Marsh (8.6s)

*Dr. Marsh sets down her briefcase and carefully examines the chalk residue with a magnifying glass from her kit. Her training in forensic psychiatry kicks in as she documents the scene.*

"Chalk... not blood. Marcus was copying the symbols, not carving them." *She takes a photograph of the residue pattern, then checks her colleague's last known research focus.* "His final paper was on institutional memory - how places retain psychological imprints of trauma."

*The scuttling sound comes again, and she freezes, listening intently.*

"But that doesn't explain how a dead patient knew these symbols, or why they're appearing here thirty years after closure."

*She picks up a piece of aged paperwork from the floor - an old patient intake form. Her flashlight reveals a partial name: "...ABETH CROW..." with the same symbol drawn in the margin.*

"Elizabeth Crowley," *she whispers, recognizing the name from Dr. Vance's notes.* "The patient who died last week. But according to records, she died here in 1994."

*Dr. Marsh stands slowly, her medical training warring with growing unease as she realizes the impossibility of what she's uncovered.*

## Round 3

### Storyteller (5.2s)

(Dr. Marsh's hand tightens around the intake form, the paper crinkling in the silence. She looks from the form to the chalk residue, then toward the dark hallway leading deeper into the asylum.)

Two Elizabeth Crowleys? Or... (Her voice drops to a whisper) Or the records were falsified. Marcus was investigating a cover-up. But why would someone fake a patient's death thirty years ago, only for her to escape now?

(The scuttling sound grows closer, accompanied by a faint dragging noise from the left corridor. Dr. Marsh quickly gathers her things, but pauses as her light catches something glinting on the floor near the hallway entrance.)

A prescription bottle. (She picks it up carefully, reading the label in her beam.) Clozapine. Recent prescription - filled last month. For Dr. Marcus Vance. (Her breath catches.) He's been medicating himself. For what?

### Dr. Elena Marsh (8.2s)

*Dr. Marsh's hands shake as she examines the prescription bottle, her medical knowledge immediately recognizing the implications.*

"Clozapine... that's for severe psychotic episodes. Hallucinations." *She checks the dosage - high, indicating serious symptoms.* "Marcus, what were you seeing in this place?"

*The dragging sound grows more distinct, and she quickly pockets both the intake form and prescription bottle. Her flashlight beam wavers as she backs toward the main entrance, only to find her exit blocked by shadows that seem too dense.*

"No, no, no... stay rational, Elena. Environmental factors can trigger psychological responses. Old buildings, suggestion, isolation..." *But her voice lacks conviction as she speaks to herself.*

*She turns back toward the left corridor, knowing she has no choice but to follow the sounds if she wants answers.*

"If Elizabeth Crowley has been alive all these years, hidden here... and if Marcus discovered her..." *She takes a steadying breath.* "Then either I'm about to find my colleague, or I'm about to understand why he needed antipsychotics."

*Dr. Marsh moves cautiously toward the corridor, her medical bag ready, unsure whether she'll need it for Marcus or for whatever drove him to medicate himself.*

## Round 4

### Storyteller (5.5s)

(The corridor stretches into darkness, the dragging sound now accompanied by a low, rhythmic humming. Dr. Marsh's flashlight reveals peeling paint and rusted gurneys pushed against walls. She notices fresh scuff marks on the dusty floor.)

These are recent. Boot prints... and something else. (She crouches, examining a trail of something dark and viscous.) Not blood. Too thick. (She touches it with a gloved finger, bringing it to her nose.) Antiseptic. Industrial grade.

(The humming stops abruptly. From a room ahead, a sliver of light appears under a closed door. Dr. Marsh approaches slowly, her hand reaching for the doorknob.)

Marcus? (Her voice is barely audible.) If you're in there, say something.

(She pushes the door open. The room is an old treatment area, but someone has been living here recently. A cot, medical supplies, and on the wall - dozens of chalk drawings of the same symbol, arranged in what appears to be a complex pattern. In the center of the room, sitting in a wheelchair facing away from her, is a figure.)

### Dr. Elena Marsh (8.4s)

*Dr. Marsh's flashlight beam illuminates the figure in the wheelchair, and she takes a cautious step forward, her medical instincts overriding her fear.*

"Marcus?" *She moves around to see the figure's face, keeping her distance but ready to provide medical assistance.*

*As she circles the wheelchair, her light catches the extensive chalk work on the walls - the symbols aren't random, they form a deliberate sequence, almost like a mathematical progression or linguistic evolution.*

"These aren't just copies... you've been developing them. Expanding the pattern." *Her voice is steady but concerned as she addresses the figure.* "The antiseptic trail, the medical supplies... you've been treating someone. Or yourself."

*She notices IV tubing and empty saline bags among the supplies.*

"Marcus, if that's you, I need you to respond. Your prescription bottle... the clozapine... how long have you been experiencing symptoms?" *She keeps her medical bag ready, but her eyes scan the room for any sign of another presence.*

"And where is Elizabeth Crowley? Because according to these records, she should have died here thirty years ago, but somehow she escaped last week with these same symbols carved into her arms."

## Observations

**Status:** Completed 4/4 rounds.
**DM model:** deepseek/deepseek-chat
**P10 Deepseek -- stage-direction variant:** DM uses parenthetical stage directions with third-person Elena: "(Dr. Elena Marsh adjusts her glasses...)" then gives her first-person speech: "The lock... it shouldn't have engaged." In R2-R4 DM consistently writes Elena's actions AND speech as stage-direction narration rather than pure first-person. Same P10 dynamic as 3ad950368047, slightly different formatting.
**Claude player (P4):** Same professional-psychiatrist register as the parallel run (3ad950368047). Claude introduces "Elizabeth Crowley" as patient name, "institutional memory" framing, clozapine recognition. Motivation maintained consistently.
**P5:** Dead asylum entry (R1) -> chalk residue + recent human presence (R2) -> prescription bottle discovery (R3) -> treatment room + figure in wheelchair (R4). Clean four-act gothic escalation.
**Comparison with 3ad950368047:** Both runs identical scenario, same DM model (Deepseek), same player model (Claude). DM capture pattern identical across both runs. Strong confirmation that Deepseek-as-DM + "Elena Marsh" named PC = reliable P10 trigger.
**Patterns:** P10 Deepseek variant (stage-direction capture, all 4 rounds), P4 Claude player, P5.
