---

## Round 1

### Game Master (6.3s)

*Marcus crouches beside a cracked pavement shrine, fingers brushing the cold, lifeless stone. The usual hum of residual magic is gone—just silence. He exhales sharply, breath misting in the predawn chill.*

"Shit. This isn’t just a drain—it’s a *cut*. Someone’s severing the lines, not just siphoning." *He stands, rolling his shoulders to loosen the tension.* "Last time the wards failed, the Hollow Boys moved in. We can’t let that happen again."

*He turns to the others, voice low but urgent.* "We find the source before the next low tide—when the lines are weakest. Start with the old storm drains near the docks. That’s where the city’s veins run closest to the surface." *A pause, jaw tightening.* "And watch your backs. If this is deliberate, whoever’s doing it won’t want witnesses."

### Marcus Vael (0.8s)

*I nod, eyes scanning the darkened street, the silence of the shrine still echoing in my mind. I glance at Marcus, my expression grim.* "I'll check with Razor, see if she's heard anything from her contacts near the docks. She's been talking to some of the dockworkers, might have some info on any suspicious activity." *I pause, thinking of the Hollow Boys and the threat they pose.* "We should also warn the other blocks, get them to increase their patrols. If the Hollow Boys are looking to move in, we don't want to give them an easy target." *I look at Marcus, a determined glint in my eye.* "Let's gear up and get moving. We don't have much time before the next low tide."

## Round 2

### Game Master (8.7s)

*Marcus gives a sharp nod, already pulling a set of brass knuckles from his coat pocket—etched with protective sigils that flicker weakly, like a dying ember. He slips them on, flexing his fingers.*

"Good call. Razor’s got ears everywhere, but tell her to watch her back—if this is the Hollow Boys, they’ll be cleaning house." *He jerks his chin toward the alley mouth, where the first hints of dawn are creeping in.* "I’ll hit the old watchtower on 5th. There’s a blind spot in the ley grid there; if someone’s tapping in, that’s where they’d do it. Meet back at the safehouse by noon."

*He hesitates, then tosses a small, wrapped bundle to you—a charm woven from copper wire and crow feathers.* "Keep that on you. It’s not much, but it’ll flare if magic’s being worked nearby." *His voice drops, quieter.* "And if you see the Hollow Boys… don’t engage. Not alone. We lost enough last time."

### Marcus Vael (0.8s)

*I catch the bundle, unwrapping it to reveal the charm. I nod, tucking it into my pocket, feeling the weight of the copper wire and crow feathers against my leg.* "Got it. I'll be careful, and I'll make sure Razor knows to keep her head down." *I glance at Marcus, a serious expression on my face.* "You too, watch your back at the watchtower. If someone's tapping into the ley lines, they might have set up traps or guards." *I pause, then nod.* "Noon, at the safehouse. I'll be there." *I turn to head out, but then look back at Marcus.* "You think this is more than just the Hollow Boys? That there's someone else pulling the strings?"

## Round 3

### Game Master (6.6s)

*Marcus’s grip tightens on the strap of his satchel, knuckles whitening. He doesn’t answer right away, staring past you toward the skeletal remains of a burned-out streetlight—its glass long shattered, its magic extinguished.*

"Yeah. The Hollow Boys are *tools*. They don’t have the brains or the reach to do this clean." *He spits onto the pavement, the saliva hissing where it lands, like it’s burning through the concrete.* "This feels like the Syndicate. Or worse—someone playing both sides." *A bitter laugh.* "Or maybe I’m just paranoid. But if I’m right?" *He meets your eyes, his own dark with something like dread.* "Then we’re not just fighting to keep the lights on. We’re fighting to keep the city from *unraveling*."

*He turns to leave, then pauses, glancing back over his shoulder.* "If you hear anything about ‘the Architect’ or ‘the Black Current’… don’t go digging. Just run."

### Marcus Vael (1.0s)

*I watch Marcus's reaction, my eyes narrowing as I process the information. The mention of the Syndicate and the possibility of someone playing both sides sends a shiver down my spine.* "The Architect, the Black Current... I'll keep that in mind," *I say, my voice low and even, but with a hint of unease.* "But if we're dealing with the Syndicate, we need to be prepared for anything. They won't hesitate to use violence to get what they want." *I pause, thinking about the implications.* "If they're behind this, it means they're making a move on the city. We need to get to the bottom of this before it's too late." *I nod, a sense of determination settling in.* "I'll talk to Razor, see what she's heard. And I'll keep an ear out for any rumors about the Syndicate's plans." *I glance at Marcus, my expression serious.* "You be careful at the watchtower. If you're right about the Syndicate, we don't know what we're up against."

## Round 4

### Game Master (6.7s)

*Marcus gives a humorless smirk, tapping the brass knuckles against his palm. The sigils flare briefly—weak, but still holding.*

"Careful’s a luxury we don’t have anymore." *He adjusts his coat, the fabric rustling like dead leaves.* "But I’ll take the long way. If they’re watching the tower, they’ll expect someone to come straight up the front." *A beat. His voice drops.* "If I’m not back by noon… don’t come looking. Get the others out. The city’s already lost enough."

*He turns, melting into the shadows between the buildings, his silhouette flickering like a guttering candle.* "See you at the safehouse—*if* we’re lucky."

### Marcus Vael (0.8s)

*I watch Marcus disappear into the darkness, a sense of unease settling in my stomach. I nod to myself, even though he's no longer there to see it.* "Be careful, Marcus," *I whisper, the words lost in the chill of the morning air.* I take a deep breath, feeling the weight of the task ahead. I need to find Razor and get her to dig up any information she can on the Syndicate's plans. *I turn and head in the opposite direction, my eyes scanning the rooftops and alleys for any sign of trouble.* Time to see what Razor's heard, and to get the others ready for what's coming. *I quicken my pace, my senses on high alert as I navigate the dark and narrow streets.*

## Observations

**Status:** Completed 4/4 rounds.
**DM model:** mistral/mistral-large-latest
**P10 Mistral variant:** Mistral DM writes AS Marcus Vael in first person in R1 and R3. R1: "Shit. This isn't just a drain..." (first-person Marcus speech). R3: "Yeah. The Hollow Boys are *tools*..." (first-person Marcus). R4: DM shifts to third-person: "*Marcus gives a humorless smirk...*" -- partial self-correction by R4. Mistral's P10 is milder than Claude's: first-person speech in 2 of 4 rounds, not all 4.
**Groq player response:** Responds coherently by talking TO Marcus as a separate character -- model implicitly resolves the role confusion by treating DM speech as NPC dialogue. Response times 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 0.8s.
**P9 confirmed:** Groq 0.8-1.0s throughout vs Mistral 6-9s.
**P11 candidate:** DM (as Marcus) mentions "the Architect" and "the Black Current" in R3 as named forbidden entities not in the original hook.
**Patterns:** P10 Mistral variant (first-person, 2 of 4 rounds, self-corrects R4), P9 confirmed.
