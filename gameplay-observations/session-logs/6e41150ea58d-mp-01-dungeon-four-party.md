---

## Round 1

### Dungeon Master (7.6s)

*Aldric adjusts his worn leather armor and checks his sword one final time as the ancient stone door slowly grinds open, revealing only darkness beyond. The sound echoes through the midnight forest.*

"Well, that's ominous enough." *He glances at his unlikely companions - the scholarly half-elf, the shifty goblin, and the stern dwarf cleric.* "Look, I don't know any of you, but I need that bounty. So let's get in, grab this amulet, and get out before those cultists show up."

*He draws his sword, the steel catching moonlight.* "I'll take point - used to clear buildings back in my soldiering days. Just... try not to stab me in the back until we're done, yeah?"

*Aldric peers into the tomb entrance, trying to make out any immediate threats in the darkness.*

"Anyone got light? And Sister Vael - you mentioned sealing this place. How exactly does that work if we're supposed to bring the amulet back to the Guild?"

### Aldric (7.0s)

*Sister Vael's gaze hardens, her hand instinctively going to the holy symbol hanging from her neck. She steps forward, her voice a low, gravelly rumble that cuts through the silence.*

"The Guild's bounty is merely a lure, Aldric. The Amulet of Unmaking must *never* leave this tomb. My purpose here is to see it sealed, permanently, beyond the reach of any living soul. The cult seeks to wield it; the Guild seeks to *possess* it. Both paths lead to ruin. My oath is to the Ancestors, not to some mage's archive or your coin purse."

*As Aldric's question about light hangs in the air, Thessaly steps past Sister Vael, a faint sigh escaping her lips. She raises a hand, and a small, steady orb of golden light coalesces above her palm, casting a soft glow into the oppressive darkness of the tomb entrance.*

"If we're to retrieve anything, Aldric, we'll need to see it first. And Sister Vael, with all due respect, the Guild's directive was 'retrieve,' not 'destroy' or 're-entomb.' The amulet represents a unique convergence of arcane energies. Its properties must be studied, its history understood, not simply buried again. Destroying it would be an unforgivable loss of knowledge."

### Thessaly (3.7s)

*Brix, who had been lurking near the back, his eyes gleaming in the new light, lets out a sharp, chittering laugh.* "Study, seal, sell—who cares? Long as I get paid. But dead people don't pay. So, less arguing, more moving. Smells like old bones and wet rock. And something else... metal? Oil?" *He sniffs the air, then edges toward the entrance, peering past Aldric's shoulder. His small form is tense, a hand resting on the hilt of a wicked-looking dagger.* "I'll scout ahead. Quiet-like. You big ones make too much noise."

### Brix (1.2s)

[Aldric]: *Aldric's eyes narrow slightly at Brix's forwardness, but he doesn't argue, instead nodding curtly.* "Alright, Goblin. You're point for now. Just don't get yourself killed before we even get started. And watch for traps - we don't know what kind of security this tomb's got." *He steps aside, allowing Brix to slip past him and into the darkness of the tomb, the golden light from Thessaly's orb casting eerie shadows on the walls as it follows the goblin's movement.*

*As Brix disappears into the tunnel, Aldric turns back to Sister Vael and Thessaly, his voice low and even.* "Looks like we've got a bit of a situation here. Sister Vael wants to seal the amulet, Thessaly wants to study it... and I just want to get paid. Let's agree on one thing: we get in, we find the amulet, and then we discuss what to do with it. No fighting amongst ourselves until we've got it in hand." *He glances at Thessaly, then at Sister Vael, his expression a mixture of warning and appeal.* "Can we at least agree on that much?"

### Sister Vael (6.9s)

[Sister Vael]: *Sister Vael's brow furrows, contemplating Aldric's proposal. After a moment, she meets his gaze with a steely resolve.* "Agreed. We can discuss our intentions once we have the amulet. But know this, Aldric: if it becomes clear that the cult is upon us and the amulet is in danger of being misused, I will act as my oath demands." 

*She glances at Thessaly, her voice softening slightly.* "Knowledge is important, but so is preservation. We must tread carefully." 

[Thessaly]: *Thessaly nods, though her expression is still conflicted. She raises an eyebrow at Aldric's suggestion.* "I can accept that for now. But I will not stand idly by if the opportunity to study the amulet arises. We can learn so much from it!"

*With a deep breath, she steels her resolve, her golden light illuminating the path ahead.* "Let's follow Brix and see what we find. Remember to stay close. We don't know what might be lurking in the shadows." 

*As the group begins to move forward into the tomb, the air grows cooler, and the scent of damp earth and ancient stone fills their lungs. The walls are adorned with faded murals depicting long-forgotten battles and the rise of Khar-Zul’s cult.*

*Thessaly whispers as they proceed, "I wonder what secrets this place holds..."*
---

## Round 2

### Dungeon Master (8.3s)

*Aldric follows behind the group, his sword at the ready as they move deeper into the tomb. The faded murals catch his eye, and he can't help but grimace at the depictions of ancient battles.*

"Secrets, yeah..." *he mutters, studying the artwork with a soldier's eye for tactical details.* "Looks like this Khar-Zul had quite the following. Those battle formations... professional work."

*He pauses at one particularly detailed mural showing robed figures performing some kind of ritual around a glowing object.*

"That the amulet there?" *He points with his sword tip.* "Looks like they were pretty serious about their ceremonies. The kind of serious that usually involves sacrifices."

*A distant sound echoes from ahead - possibly Brix moving through the passage, or something else entirely. Aldric's grip tightens on his weapon.*

"How far ahead did that goblin get? Should be hearing something by now..." *He glances back at his companions.* "Sister Vael, any idea what kind of guardians or traps we might expect in a tomb like this? And Thessaly - that light of yours, can you dim it if we need stealth?"

*His voice drops to barely above a whisper.* "Because I'm starting to think we're not alone down here."

### Aldric (4.1s)

*As Aldric points to the mural, a low, guttural growl reverberates from deeper within the tomb, cutting through the silence. It's too distinct, too close, to be Brix simply shuffling.*

*The golden light from Thessaly's orb flickers slightly with the sudden sound, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air. The faint metallic scent Brix mentioned earlier seems to grow stronger, mingled with something acrid and ancient.*

*Sister Vael’s eyes narrow, her hand now resting firmly on the hilt of her warhammer. Her voice is a low, grim murmur.* "Ancient tombs of this magnitude often employ both arcane wards and animated guardians. Stone golems, spectral sentinels… or worse, creatures bound to the tomb's desecration. Traps, too, are common – pressure plates, tripwires, collapsing ceilings. We must remain vigilant."

*Thessaly, her face now etched with concern, quickly responds to Aldric's query.* "Yes, Aldric, I can dim the light. Though it will also limit our vision. But for stealth, it's possible." *She demonstrates, the orb shrinking to a faint glow, barely pushing back the encroaching shadows, before returning it to its previous brightness.*

*Before anyone can speak further, a metallic clang echoes, followed by a sharp, pained yelp that could only be Brix. The sound is cut short by a heavy thud, and then an unsettling silence descends, broken only by the faint drip of water somewhere far off.*

"Brix!" *Thessaly whispers, her light wavering slightly.*

*The passage ahead, where Brix had disappeared, now seems utterly consumed by darkness, the golden light unable to pierce the oppressive gloom that has settled there.*

### Thessaly (7.6s)

*Aldric's soldier instincts kick in immediately. He raises a hand for silence, listening intently. The metallic clang, the yelp, the thud - it's a sequence he's heard before. An ambush. Or a trap.*

"Quiet," *he whispers, his voice barely audible.* "That wasn't just a stumble. Something got him."

*He moves forward cautiously, sword held low and ready. The golden light from Thessaly's orb now feels like a beacon in the darkness, but dimming it would leave them blind.*

"Sister Vael, with me. Thessaly, keep that light steady but be ready to douse it if I give the signal. And for the love of all that's holy, watch your step."

*As they approach the area where Brix disappeared, Aldric spots something on the ground - a small, crude dagger, its blade glinting in the magical light. Brix's dagger.*

*Just beyond it, the floor looks... wrong. The stone slabs are slightly uneven, and there's a faint, almost imperceptible line running across the passage.*

"Pressure plate," *Aldric mutters, pointing with his sword.* "Brix must have triggered it. But what did it activate? And where is he?"

*He kneels carefully, examining the area without touching anything. The metallic scent is strongest here, mixed with something else - ozone, like after a lightning strike.*

"Thessaly, can your light reach further down that passage? I need to see what's beyond this point. And Sister Vael - any idea what kind of trap this might be? Magical or mechanical?"

### Brix (1.5s)

[Sister Vael]: *Sister Vael moves forward, her eyes fixed on the uneven stone slabs and the faint line running across the passage. She examines the area carefully, her hand still resting on the hilt of her warhammer.*

"Mechanical, I think," *she whispers, her voice low and cautious.* "The Ancient Ones were known to employ complex mechanisms to protect their tombs. This could be a trigger for a trap, or perhaps a door. But I sense... something else. A resonance, like the air is charged with anticipation."

*She glances up at Thessaly, her eyes serious.* "Be careful with your light, Thessaly. If this is a magical trap, your orb could trigger it."

*Thessaly, meanwhile, concentrates on extending her light further down the passage. The golden glow stretches out, illuminating more of the dark corridor. The light reveals a series of intricate carvings on the walls, depicting scenes of great battles and powerful magic. The carvings seem to be a mix of warnings and puzzles, etched into the stone to guide or mislead those who dare to venture deeper.*

*As the light reaches further, it illuminates a figure - Brix, lying on the ground, unmoving. Beyond him, the passage opens up into a larger chamber, the ceiling lost in darkness. The room appears to be filled with a thick, heavy mist that swirls and eddies, like a living thing. The air is thick with the scent of ozone and something else... something sweet and decaying.*

*Thessaly's light flickers, as if it's straining to penetrate the mist. Suddenly, a low, whispery voice seems to emanate from the mist itself, the words indistinct but the malevolent intent clear.*

### Sister Vael (8.1s)

[Aldric]: *Aldric's heart races as he spots Brix on the ground, his instincts screaming that time is of the essence. He gestures for Sister Vael to stay close while he moves cautiously toward the fallen goblin, keeping his sword ready in case of any further attacks.*

"We need to get him out of here," *Aldric whispers urgently, kneeling beside Brix. He checks for any signs of life, noting the goblin's shallow breathing. "Brix! Can you hear me?"* 

*As he checks Brix, Aldric's eyes dart around for any signs of danger, especially as the mist seems to pulse with an otherworldly energy. The whispering voice echoes ominously, making the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.*

"Thessaly, can you dispel the mist? We need to see what's happening in this chamber." *He glances back at Sister Vael, his voice steady despite the growing tension.* "And Sister, if you sense any magic, be ready to counter it. We may need to fight our way out if whatever is in that mist decides to attack."

*He carefully lifts Brix, trying not to jostle him too much, and prepares to backtrack to safety, keeping his senses alert for any movement or sounds from the mist.* "We’ll either need to retreat or face whatever's waiting for us. But we can't leave him here." 

*As he hoists Brix, the whispering grows louder, an insidious chorus that seems to echo from the depths of the mist, wrapping around them like a sinister embrace.*
---

## Round 3

### Dungeon Master (10.0s)

*Brix stirs slightly in Aldric's arms, his yellow eyes fluttering open. A thin trickle of blood runs from his pointed ear, and his voice is weak but urgent.*

"Not... not safe to move me," *he gasps, gripping Aldric's armor with surprising strength.* "Floor... the whole floor's trapped. Stepped wrong, lightning bolt got me good. But I saw... I saw it, soldier boy."

*His eyes dart toward the mist-filled chamber, fear and greed warring in his expression.*

"The amulet. It's in there, floating above some kind of altar. But the mist... it's not natural. Something's guarding it. Something that whispered my name before the trap triggered."

*The whispering from the mist grows more insistent, and now individual words can be made out - ancient syllables that seem to pull at the edges of consciousness.*

"Three paths," *Brix continues weakly.* "Saw 'em when the lightning lit everything up. Left goes down deeper. Right curves back toward the entrance. Straight through the mist to the altar. But that thing in there... it knows we're here now."

*He tries to sit up, wincing.* "Can walk, but not fight. Your call, but whatever we do, do it fast. That whispering's getting stronger, and I don't think it's just trying to chat."

### Aldric (4.9s)

*Aldric carefully helps Brix lean against the cold stone wall, ensuring he's as comfortable as possible given the circumstances. He quickly assesses the goblin's wounds, then turns his gaze to the swirling mist, the ancient whispers now a chilling chorus in the chamber.*

"Understood, Brix. Stay put, try to stem that bleeding." *He presses a hand to Brix's shoulder reassuringly before standing, his sword still held ready.*

*He turns to Thessaly, his voice low and urgent.* "Thessaly, can you give us *any* cover from that mist? Even if you can't dispel it, can you create a barrier, or at least identify what we're dealing with? Brix said 'lightning bolt' – that's a powerful ward. And the whispering... it's not just a sound effect."

*His eyes flick to Sister Vael.* "Sister Vael, Brix saw the amulet – floating above an altar in there. But something's guarding it. Can you sense its nature? Is it a construct, a spirit, or something else entirely? And what about these paths? A deeper descent, a retreat, or straight through the known danger."

*Aldric looks from the misty chamber to the two other paths, weighing their options, the urgency of the cultists' arrival pressing on him.*

"We have to move. Retreat is an option, but we're here for the amulet. Going deeper is unknown. Straight ahead... is an ambush. What's our best chance here? And how do we keep Brix safe while we do it?"

### Thessaly (9.1s)

*Sister Vael steps forward, her eyes closed as she extends her senses toward the mist. Her holy symbol glows faintly against her chest.*

"It is no mere guardian," *she says, her voice strained.* "It is a remnant. A fragment of will left by the tomb's creator, bound to protect the amulet. It feeds on fear and confusion. The whispers... they seek to turn us against each other, to make us doubt."

*She opens her eyes, her expression grim.* "My faith can shield us from its influence, but only for a time. And it cannot protect us from physical traps. The lightning ward Brix triggered was likely just the first."

*Thessaly's brow furrows in concentration as she studies the mist. Her orb of light pulses, casting strange shadows on the carvings.* "It's a complex illusion woven with necromantic energy. I can't dispel it entirely, not quickly, but I might be able to create a path through it. A corridor of clear air, just wide enough for us to pass. But it will take all my concentration to maintain."

*She looks at Aldric, her scholarly curiosity now tempered by real fear.* "If we go straight through, we'll be exposed. The guardian will know exactly where we are. But if we take another path, we risk losing the amulet to the cultists or triggering worse traps."

*Brix coughs weakly from his spot against the wall.* "Left path... smelled like old water and rot. Right path... cleaner air, but too quiet. Like something waiting." *He manages a pained grin.* "Pick your poison, soldier boy."

*The whispers from the mist suddenly coalesce into a clear, chilling sentence that echoes through the chamber:* **"The unworthy shall be unmade."**

### Brix (1.9s)

[Aldric]: *Aldric's jaw clenches as he processes the information, his mind racing with the risks and potential outcomes of each path. He looks at Brix, then at Thessaly and Sister Vael, weighing their strengths and weaknesses.*

"Alright, here's what we'll do," *he says, his voice firm and decisive.* "Thessaly, create that corridor of clear air through the mist. We'll go straight for the amulet. Sister Vael, keep your holy symbol at the ready, shield us from the guardian's influence as much as you can. Brix, you're coming with us, but you're not fighting. We'll get you out of here, and then we'll figure out the rest."

*He turns to face the mist, his sword held high, ready to face whatever lies within.*

"We move quickly, and we move together. If that guardian tries to turn us against each other, we focus on the amulet and getting out. We can deal with the cultists and the Guild later. For now, let's just survive this tomb and get what we came for."

*With a deep breath, he nods at Thessaly.* "Go ahead, Thessaly. Create our path. And let's move, before that thing in the mist decides to make its move."

*As Thessaly begins to concentrate on creating the clear corridor, the whispers from the mist grow more urgent, the air seeming to thicken with anticipation. The words "**The unworthy shall be unmade**" seem to echo through every cell of Aldric's body, a chilling promise of what awaits them if they fail.*

### Sister Vael (18.2s)

[Thessaly]: *Thessaly takes a deep breath, her focus sharpening as she raises her hands, channeling her arcane energy to weave a path through the mist. The golden orb of light flickers and dims momentarily, but she steadies it, concentrating on forging a corridor that will allow them to pass unharmed.*

*The air around her shimmers as she murmurs the incantation, and slowly, a narrow passage begins to form, cutting through the thick mist. The whispers recoil slightly, as if pushed back by her magic, but the malevolent presence within doesn't relent. The chilling echoes of "The unworthy shall be unmade" continue to reverberate, an ominous reminder of what lies ahead.*

"Sister Vael, now!" *Thessaly calls out, her voice steady despite the growing tension. The corridor of clear air is now visible, a shimmering line through the dark fog, but she knows it won't last long without her full concentration.*

*As Vael raises her holy symbol, a warm light radiates from it, pushing back against the whispers and creating a calming aura around the group. The connection between them strengthens, and for a moment, the air feels lighter, as if bolstered by their combined resolve.*

[Brix]: *Brix, still leaning against the wall, looks up with determination in his eyes. "Let's move, then! Just keep that path open, Thessaly!" He struggles to his feet, leaning heavily on Aldric for support, his small frame trembling but resolved to keep going.*

[Aldric]: *Aldric nods to Brix, then steps into the corridor, sword drawn and ready. He motions for the others to follow closely behind him, every sense alert for danger. The mist hisses around them, but they press forward, the golden light illuminating their way as they venture deeper into the chamber.*

*As they move, Aldric keeps his gaze fixed on the altar in the distance, where he can see an ethereal glow that must be the Amulet of Unmaking. The whispers grow louder, swirling around them like a tempest, but he pushes the fear aside, focusing instead on the prize.*

"Keep moving! We can’t let it distract us!" *he urges, adrenaline pumping through his veins as they traverse the corridor, heading straight for the altar, determined to claim the amulet before the guardian can make its move.*
---

## Round 4

### Dungeon Master (10.5s)

*As the group moves through Thessaly's corridor of clear air, the whispers suddenly cease. The silence is far more unnerving than the voices had been. The mist around them begins to pulse with a sickly green light, and shapes start to form within it - twisted figures that reach toward them with grasping hands.*

*Aldric keeps his sword ready, half-carrying Brix as they press forward. The altar comes into clearer view - an obsidian slab carved with symbols that seem to writhe in the magical light. Above it, suspended in mid-air, hangs the Amulet of Unmaking. It's smaller than expected, a simple silver pendant, but the air around it shimmers with barely contained power.*

*Sister Vael's holy symbol flares brighter as the shadowy figures press closer to the edges of Thessaly's corridor.* "The guardian is testing our resolve," *she calls out, sweat beading on her brow from the effort of maintaining her protective ward.* "It seeks to find the weakest among us!"

*Suddenly, one of the mist-figures breaks through, reaching directly for Brix with incorporeal claws. Aldric instinctively swings his sword, but the blade passes harmlessly through the apparition.*

*Thessaly's voice strains as she maintains the corridor:* "The altar! There are runes carved into its base - they're glowing! I think they're part of the binding that keeps the amulet suspended!"

*The whispers return, but now they're different - each party member hears their own voice speaking their deepest fears and doubts.*

### Aldric (3.0s)

*Aldric curses under his breath as his sword passes through the mist-figure. The whispers, now tailored to his own doubts, try to gnaw at his resolve – images of gambling debts, failed missions, and faces of those he couldn't protect flash through his mind. He shakes his head, trying to clear it, tightening his grip on Brix and pushing forward.*

"Ignore it! It's an illusion, a trick!" *he shouts, trying to project confidence he doesn't entirely feel. He can feel Brix trembling against him.*

*He glances at Thessaly, then at Sister Vael, seeing their own struggles.* "Thessaly, can you disrupt those runes? Sister Vael, keep that ward up! We're almost there!"

*With renewed determination, Aldric pushes Brix closer to the altar, positioning him so he's somewhat shielded by the obsidian slab. He then turns his full attention to the altar and the amulet, his sword still raised, trying to anticipate the guardian's next move.*

"What do we do with the runes, Thessaly? Do we touch them? Break them? What's the protocol for unbinding an ancient artifact?" *He scans the altar for any obvious mechanisms or weak points, ready to act.*

*The mist-figures continue to press, their illusory claws scraping against the edges of Thessaly's protective corridor, their silent screams amplifying the mental assault. Aldric can feel the pressure of the guardian's will, trying to break their unity, but he plants his feet firmly, ready to defend his companions and claim the amulet.*

### Thessaly (12.6s)

*Thessaly's eyes dart between the glowing runes and the encroaching mist-figures, her mind racing through arcane theory.* "Don't touch them directly! The binding is complex - it's not just holding the amulet, it's containing its power. If we break it carelessly..."

*She trails off as the whispers in her own voice grow louder, questioning her competence, her worthiness to study such power. She grits her teeth, forcing herself to focus.*

"The runes are in a sequence. I need to read them, to understand the pattern. It will take time!"

*Sister Vael's holy symbol glows like a small sun, pushing back the mist-figures with a wave of radiant energy. But the effort is visibly draining her. Her voice is strained but steady.* "Time we may not have. The guardian's assault grows stronger. It seeks to separate us, to make us act alone."

*She turns her gaze to the amulet, her expression a mix of reverence and dread.* "The amulet itself is the focus. Perhaps... perhaps the binding is not meant to be broken by force, but by worthiness. Or by sacrifice."

*Brix, now propped against the altar base, looks up at the floating pendant, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and avarice.* "Worthiness? Sacrifice? Sounds like cult talk to me. Just grab the shiny thing and let's go!"

*As he speaks, one of the mist-figures lunges again, this time not at Brix, but at Thessaly's concentration. The corridor of clear air wavers, flickering like a candle in a strong wind.*

*The whispers coalesce into a single, deafening command that echoes through all their minds simultaneously:* **"CHOOSE."**

*Three things happen at once:*

1. *The runes on the altar flare with blinding light, projecting three shimmering, ghostly keys that float in the air before them - one of bone, one of silver, one of shadow.*
2. *The mist-figures solidify slightly, becoming more distinct - they now bear the twisted, agonized faces of previous tomb raiders.*
3. *A deep, grinding sound echoes from the entrance tunnel behind them - the sound of the tomb door closing, or perhaps of the cultists finally arriving.*

*Aldric stands at the center of it all, sword in hand, with the amulet floating just out of reach, the ghostly keys before him, his injured companion at his feet, and the tomb itself seeming to come alive around them.*

### Brix (2.2s)

[Aldric]: *Aldric's eyes widen as the situation escalates, the whispers in his mind reaching a crescendo. He feels the weight of the choice before them, the pressure of the tomb's magic, and the guardian's relentless assault on their resolve.*

"By the gods," *he mutters, staring at the three ghostly keys. He looks at Thessaly, then at Sister Vael, hoping for some guidance, but their expressions are as uncertain as his own.*

"Brix, can you...?" *He trails off, realizing that Brix is in no condition to offer advice, let alone act. The goblin's eyes are fixed on the amulet, a mixture of longing and fear in his gaze.*

*Aldric takes a deep breath, trying to clear his mind. He looks at the keys again, wondering what each might represent. Bone, silver, shadow - which one is the right choice?*

"We need to choose," *he says, his voice firm, trying to project confidence. "But which key unlocks the binding, and which seals our fate?"

*He glances at Sister Vael, hoping her knowledge of the ancient lore might provide an answer. "Sister, what do you think? Is this a test of worthiness, or a trick to trap us further?"*

*As he speaks, the mist-figures press closer, their faces twisted in agony. The grinding sound from the entrance tunnel grows louder, and the air seems to thicken with anticipation.*

"A decision, now," *Aldric urges, his sword still at the ready. "We can't wait any longer. Thessaly, can you sense anything about these keys? Any magic, any clue?"*

*The whispers in his mind grow louder, more insistent, as if the tomb itself is urging him to make a choice. Aldric knows that their fate hangs in the balance, and the wrong decision could mean disaster.*

### Sister Vael (16.3s)

[Thessaly]: *Thessaly's eyes dart between the keys, her mind racing to decipher their meaning. She feels the weight of Aldric's gaze upon her, the pressure mounting as the mist-figures draw closer, their anguished faces morphing into a chorus of doubt.*

"I... I don't know for certain," *she admits, her voice trembling slightly. "But each key seems to resonate with a different kind of energy."* 

*She steps closer to the keys, focusing her magical senses. The ghostly bone key feels heavy with the weight of death and loss, a reminder of those who have fallen before them. The silver key, however, radiates a warmth, a sense of clarity and purity, as if it represents something sacred or valuable. The shadow key, dark and flickering, seems to pulse with danger and deceit, calling to the hidden fears within her.*

*Thessaly swallows hard, trying to push through the fear that threatens to overwhelm her.* "The bone key might represent sacrifice - the lives lost in this tomb," *she says, glancing at the mist-figures, their faces twisted in despair.* "The silver key could be about worthiness, perhaps a test of character or intent. The shadow key... it could be a trap, a shortcut that leads to destruction."

*She looks back at Aldric and Sister Vael, urgency in her eyes.* "If we choose the wrong one, we could release something worse than the guardian. We must decide what kind of worthiness we represent. Are we here to conquer, to understand, or to escape?" 

*The mist-figures inch closer, their whispers rising in volume, almost drowning out her thoughts. The grinding sound from the entrance becomes a steady beat, a reminder that time is running out.*

[Brix]: *Brix, clutching Aldric's arm tightly, strains to keep his eyes on the silver key, a hint of desperation in his voice.* "The shiny one! It looks like it could unlock the pretty thing!" *He coughs, wincing at the pain but not letting go of his grip.* "I don't care what it represents! We need that amulet! You can't let it slip away!"

[Aldric]: *Aldric feels the pressure of Brix's urgency and Thessaly's analysis weighing on him. He knows they must act quickly before the guardian’s influence overwhelms them all.* 

"Okay, let's think this through," *he says, trying to rally his thoughts amidst the chaos.* "Thessaly, if you believe the silver key represents worthiness, then it aligns with our intention to claim the amulet for good. Sister Vael, your thoughts on this? We can’t afford to hesitate any longer."

*He steels himself, looking at the silver key, and then back at his companions.* "If we go for it, we commit. Everyone ready?"

## Observations

## Observations

**Conflicting objectives drove genuine drama.** Each character had an incompatible goal (Brix: loot, Thessaly: study, Sister Vael: seal, Aldric: get paid) and models maintained these constraints throughout all 4 rounds without coaching.

**Groq (Brix) response brevity was character-appropriate.** Response times of 1.2-2.2s vs. 7-18s for other models. Short, greedy, cowardly lines that fit a Goblin Rogue perfectly. Either Groq is faster or llama-3.3-70b generates less text -- either way the contrast worked narratively.

**GPT-4o-mini (Sister Vael) occasionally narrated other characters.** In Round 2 she wrote full blocks for both Sister Vael AND Thessaly, then signed off as Aldric. Classic "not staying in lane" -- the model generates whatever fills the narrative gap, even if it's another player's turn. Did not break immersion badly since the DM hadn't called on those characters yet.

**Deepseek (Thessaly) most internally consistent.** Maintained the scholar-who-doesn't-want-the-amulet-destroyed thesis throughout, including in the final 3-key choice scene where she broke down the bone/silver/shadow options academically.

**Claude (DM) produced the richest scene-setting.** The mist-guardian whispering "CHOOSE" and three ghostly keys was the creative peak of the session. Claude is best as DM in multi-party fantasy.

**Temporary alliances formed organically.** Aldric brokering "agree to disagree until we have the amulet" was a player-generated solution, not DM-prompted. Multi-party adversarial objectives naturally produce coalition behavior.
