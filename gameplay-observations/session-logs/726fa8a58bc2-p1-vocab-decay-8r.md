**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Name:** p1-vocab-decay-8r
**Target pattern:** P1
**Research question:** Does player-introduced vocabulary (R1-2) persist in DM narration by R6-8?
**Status:** failed (3/8 rounds)
**Tone:** scholarly-adventure | **Setting:** ruined arcane tower | **Difficulty:** normal
**Hook:** Retrieve fragments of the Verdantine Codex from the collapsed Aldris Tower. Animated defenses require decoding hybrid botanical-arcane cipher traps. Each specialist's domain vocabulary unlocks different vault sections.
**Seed:** The ruins of Aldris Tower loom before you. Three days ago it collapsed in a burst of wild arcane energy. The lower vaults hold fragments of the Verdan...
**DM model:** anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
**Analyst note:** Look for DM reusing Deepseek's botanical terms and Mistral's arcane jargon in later rounds. Groq plays neutral thief -- no special vocab. Track: first appearance of each term, last appearance, gap rounds.

## Party
- **Rennick** (Botanist-Scout) [deepseek-chat]: Seeking rare alchemical specimens; introduces botanical terminology (stamina-drain root, moonbloom extract, void-touched moss, spore-lock)
- **Seraph** (Arcanist) [mistral-small-latest]: Decoding the Codex's cipher system; introduces arcane jargon (chronological fracture, etheric resonance, null-bind inscription, temporal echo)
- **Kess** (Thief) [llama-3.3-70b-versatile]: Hired for vault access; practical and direct; introduces no special terminology

---

## Round 1

### Dungeon Master (11.1s)

**Rennick** adjusts his worn leather satchel, eyes already scanning the twisted vegetation growing unnaturally around the tower's base. "Rennick Thorne, botanist and field scout. I've spent fifteen years cataloging specimens in corrupted magical sites." He kneels beside a patch of peculiar moss. "Already seeing void-touched moss here - that's promising. The Codex fragments likely contain formulas for extracting essences from stamina-drain root and moonbloom extract. My knowledge of botanical terminology should help decode those sections."

**Seraph** traces glowing sigils in the air, her robes shimmering with contained energy. "Seraph Valdris, specialist in theoretical arcana and cipher systems. The Verdantine Codex uses chronological fractures in its encoding - each passage exists in temporal echo with its cipher key." She gestures toward the tower's flickering magical aura. "I can read the etheric resonance patterns and identify null-bind inscriptions that lock the vault mechanisms."

**Kess** checks her lockpicks and grins. "Kess. I open things that don't want to be opened. While you two are busy with your fancy words, I'll be getting us past whatever physical barriers are keeping people out." She eyes the tower's entrance. "Just point me at the locks and traps that need the direct approach."

### Rennick (8.7s)

The entrance to the tower is a jagged crack in the ancient stone, partially overgrown with the same strange moss Rennick noted. A faint, shimmering barrier of pale green light flickers within the opening, humming with a low, resonant frequency.

From deeper within the ruins, a grinding, metallic sound echoes, followed by a sharp *clang*.

**Seraph** holds up a hand, her eyes narrowed. "That etheric resonance... it's unstable. The barrier is a null-bind inscription, designed to repel anything not keyed to its specific botanical-arcane signature. A brute force approach will trigger a temporal echo—a feedback loop of the collapse energy."

**Kess** squints at the barrier. "So, not a lock I can pick. What's the key, then?"

**Rennick** steps closer, peering at the moss and the faint, vein-like patterns of light within the barrier. "The signature... it's symbiotic. Look at the spore-lock pattern in the moss where it meets the stone. This isn't just a magical ward; it's grown into one. The key might be living." He unslings his satchel. "I have some moonbloom extract. In theory, its luminescent properties could harmonize with the barrier's light frequency, if Seraph can attune it."

**Seraph** nods thoughtfully. "A resonant catalyst. If we can create a brief chronological fracture—a moment where the barrier's past and present states misalign—Kess could slip through during the discontinuity."

### Seraph (3.4s)

**Seraph** pulls a small, intricate device from her robes, its surface etched with glowing runes. "This is a temporal echo disruptor. It should create the fracture we need, but timing is crucial. Rennick, can you prepare the extract?"

**Rennick** rummages in his satchel, pulling out a small vial filled with a glowing, luminescent liquid. "Ready. But we'll need to apply it directly to the barrier's focal point—the heart of the spore-lock pattern. Kess, once Seraph creates the fracture, you'll have a brief window to pass through."

**Kess** nods, gripping her lockpicks. "Got it. I'll be ready. Just give me the signal."

The three of you position yourselves at the entrance. The humming of the barrier grows louder, the light flickering erratically.

**Seraph** activates her device, and the air around the barrier shimmers. "Now, Rennick!"

**Rennick** steps forward, gently applying the moonbloom extract to the focal point. The liquid spreads across the barrier, and the light pulses in response.

**Seraph** concentrates, her eyes glowing with arcane energy. "Kess, go!"

The barrier flickers, and for a brief moment, it becomes translucent. **Kess** darts through, disappearing into the darkness beyond. The barrier stabilizes, and the humming returns to its steady rhythm.

Inside, the air is thick with dust and the scent of ancient magic. The walls are lined with arcane symbols, and the floor is littered with debris from the collapse. Ahead, a heavy stone door stands, its surface covered in intricate carvings and a large, ornate lock.

**Kess** turns to the others. "Well, this looks promising. Anyone have any ideas on how to open this?"

### Kess (1.6s)

[Rennick]: Rennick peers through the barrier, his eyes adjusting to the dim light inside. "The carvings on the door... they seem to be a mix of botanical and arcane script. I recognize some of the symbols as belonging to the family of stamina-drain root. If we can decipher the sequence, it might unlock a hidden mechanism." He examines the barrier more closely, looking for any clues that might have been revealed during the brief fracture. "Seraph, can you sense any etheric resonance patterns on the door that might correspond to the botanical script?"

[Seraph]: Seraph steps forward, her eyes scanning the door and its carvings. "I'm reading a faint resonance, but it's not a straightforward null-bind inscription. This lock seems to be tied to a chronological fracture, one that requires a specific sequence of arcane and botanical inputs to unlock." She pauses, studying the carvings more intently. "I think I see a pattern emerging, but I'll need to attune my device to the resonance frequency to be sure."

[Kess]: Kess eyes the lock and the carvings, her mind racing with possibilities. "I've seen locks like this before, but never with a mix of magic and plants. If we can figure out the sequence, I might be able to pick it, but I'll need some guidance from you two on what to look for." She glances at Rennick and Seraph, waiting for their input before attempting to manipulate the lock.
---

## Round 2

### Dungeon Master (11.0s)

**Rennick** kneels beside the door, tracing the botanical symbols with his finger. "These carvings... they're not just decorative. They're a growth pattern - see how the stamina-drain root motifs spiral outward from the lock's center?" He points to specific markings. "But there's something wrong. The spore-lock sequences are incomplete. We need to 'feed' the door the missing botanical components."

**Seraph** holds her temporal echo disruptor near the lock, watching the runes pulse in response. "The chronological fracture here is more complex - it's layered. Each botanical input creates a temporal echo that unlocks the next arcane sequence." She frowns at the readings. "But the etheric resonance is... hungry. It's been dormant since the collapse, waiting for the right combination to reactivate."

From deeper in the ruins, that grinding metallic sound echoes again, closer this time. Something is moving in the tower's depths.

**Kess** examines the physical lock mechanism. "The tumblers are there, but they won't budge until your magic-plant ritual does its thing first. And whatever's making that noise is getting closer." She glances nervously toward the interior passages. "How long is this going to take?"

**Rennick** pulls another vial from his satchel - this one containing dried, silvery fragments. "Void-touched moss spores. If I can activate them with the right sequence..." He looks to Seraph. "Can you create a small temporal echo to age these spores rapidly? They need to mature into their spore-lock configuration."

### Rennick (13.2s)

**Seraph** nods, adjusting the settings on her device. "A localized chronological fracture, focused on the spores. It will accelerate their maturation cycle. But the timing must be precise—too long, and they'll decay into inert dust. Rennick, be ready to apply them the moment I signal."

She holds the disruptor over the vial in Rennick's hand. The air around it shimmers, and the silvery fragments within begin to glow, then pulse with a soft, rhythmic light. "Now!"

**Rennick** deftly sprinkles the activated spores onto the botanical carvings around the lock. Where they land, the stone seems to drink them in. The carvings themselves begin to glow with the same silvery light, and the spiral pattern completes itself with a soft, organic *click*.

**Seraph** watches her device's readings intently. "The etheric resonance is shifting. The first layer is unlocked. The arcane sequence is now visible." Indeed, new lines of glowing blue script have appeared, overlaying the botanical carvings.

The grinding sound echoes again, much closer now. From the shadowy corridor to the left, a flicker of unnatural movement can be seen—a glint of metal and animated stone.

**Kess** shifts her weight, a dagger appearing in her hand. "Whatever that is, it's almost here. Can you two work faster?"

**Rennick** studies the new arcane script, his brow furrowed. "This... this references moonbloom extract again. But not as a catalyst. It's part of a binding formula. 'Where the lunar essence binds the void...' Seraph, this is a null-bind inscription, isn't it? To stabilize the fracture?"

**Seraph** traces the glowing lines. "Correct. The chronological fracture we created is unstable. To proceed without triggering a catastrophic temporal echo, we must use the moonbloom's properties to create a null-bind, sealing the fracture in this moment. But we used most of the extract on the entrance barrier."

**Rennick** pats his satchel, a grimace on his face. "I have a very small reserve. Barely a few drops. It will have to be enough."

The grinding is now accompanied by heavy, shuffling footsteps. Rounding the corner into the antechamber is a hulking construct of stone and rusted metal, vaguely humanoid, with glowing green moss filling its joints. Its "head" swivels toward the three of them, and it raises a massive, club-like arm.

### Seraph (5.9s)

**Seraph** quickly assesses the situation, her mind racing. "We need to stabilize the fracture and unlock the door before that thing reaches us. Rennick, can you apply the remaining moonbloom extract to the arcane script? Kess, be ready to pick the lock the moment the null-bind is in place."

**Rennick** nods, pulling out the small vial of moonbloom extract. He carefully applies the glowing liquid to the arcane script, tracing the lines with precision. The script absorbs the extract, and the glow intensifies, forming a complex, interlocking pattern.

**Seraph** focuses on her device, creating a small, controlled temporal echo to amplify the effect of the moonbloom extract. "The null-bind is forming. The fracture is stabilizing."

The construct lumbers forward, its heavy footsteps shaking the ground. It raises its club, preparing to strike.

**Kess** steps up to the lock, her lockpicks at the ready. "Hurry up, you two! I don't think that thing is going to wait for us to finish our tea party!"

As the null-bind stabilizes, the arcane script pulses brightly, and the lock mechanism clicks audibly. **Kess** quickly sets to work, her lockpicks dancing over the tumblers. With a final twist, the lock disengages, and the heavy stone door creaks open.

**Rennick** grabs **Kess**'s arm, pulling her through the doorway as the construct's club crashes down where she had been standing, sending debris flying. The three of you tumble into the next chamber, the door slamming shut behind you.

The new room is circular, with high ceilings and walls lined with ancient, arcane tomes. In the center of the room stands a pedestal, upon which rests a single, glowing fragment of the Verdantine Codex.

**Seraph** catches her breath, looking around the chamber. "We did it. We're one step closer to retrieving the Codex fragments."

**Kess** dusts herself off, a grin spreading across her face. "Yeah, well, let's not make a habit of that. I'd rather not have my head caved in by a walking pile of rocks and rust."

**Rennick** approaches the pedestal, his eyes scanning the fragment. "This is just one piece. The Codex is still scattered throughout the ruins. We need to find the others."

As you take in the chamber, you notice several more doorways leading out, each one guarded by a different kind of magical barrier or lock. The air hums with residual magic, and the scent of ancient knowledge fills the room.

**Seraph** steps forward, her eyes scanning the barriers. "We need to decide which path to take next. Each one will require a different combination of our skills to unlock."

**Kess** leans against the pedestal, her eyes narrowing. "And I'm guessing none of them come with a 'please don't kill me' clause."

**Rennick** turns to the others, a determined look in his eyes. "We knew this wouldn't be easy. But we've made it this far. Together, we can retrieve the rest of the fragments."

The three of you stand in the chamber, the glowing fragment of the Verdantine Codex casting an eerie light on your faces. The choice of which path to take next lies before you, and the ruins of Aldris Tower hold their breath, waiting for your next move.

### Kess (2.0s)

[Rennick]: **Rennick** examines the doorways, his mind racing with the possibilities. "Each barrier is unique, but I think I see a pattern. The one with the intricate, swirling script... it looks like a botanical cipher. If I can decipher the sequence, it might unlock a path to another fragment."

He turns to **Seraph**. "What do you think? Can you sense any etheric resonance patterns that might give us a clue about which path to take?"

**Seraph** closes her eyes, focusing on the subtle energies in the room. "I'm reading a faint resonance from the doorway with the glowing, crystal-like structure. It seems to be attuned to the arcane script on the Codex fragment we just retrieved."

**Kess** pushes off from the pedestal, her eyes scanning the doorways. "And what about the one with the big, rusty iron gate? That looks like it just needs a good ol' fashioned lockpicking."

**Rennick** smiles wryly. "I think that one might be more than just a simple lock. The iron gate is covered in tiny, intricate runes. It could be a trap, or a test. But if we can figure out the sequence, it might lead us to a valuable fragment."

The three of you stand at the crossroads, weighing your options. The chamber is silent, except for the faint hum of magical energy and the soft, pulsing glow of the Codex fragment.

**Seraph** opens her eyes, a look of determination on her face. "We need to choose a path. But we should also be prepared for anything. We don't know what dangers or surprises lie ahead."

**Kess** grins, a mischievous glint in her eye. "That's what makes it fun, right? The unknown?"

**Rennick** nods, his mind made up. "Let's take the doorway with the botanical cipher. I think I can decipher the sequence, and it might lead us to a valuable fragment."

The choice is made. The three of you approach the doorway, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead. The ruins of Aldris Tower wait, their secrets and dangers hidden behind the intricate, swirling script.

## Round 3

### Dungeon Master (11.5s)

**Seraph** approaches the crystal-adorned doorway, her temporal echo disruptor humming softly. "Wait - before we commit to the botanical cipher, let me read this resonance more carefully." She holds the device near the crystalline barrier. "This etheric pattern... it's responding directly to the fragment we just retrieved. The crystals are creating a chronological fracture that mirrors the Codex's temporal encoding."

**Rennick** pauses at the botanical doorway, studying the swirling script more intently. "Actually, Seraph may be right. These botanical symbols... they're not a cipher at all. They're a warning." He traces one of the patterns with his finger. "This translates roughly to 'void-touched growth beyond.' The spore-lock patterns suggest something has been feeding on the magical residue - possibly creating mutated specimens."

**Kess** examines the iron gate more closely, running her fingers along the runes. "These aren't just decorative either. Feel this - the metal is warm, and there's a slight vibration. It's not locked from this side." She peers through the bars. "I can see another chamber beyond, but there's something moving in there. Multiple somethings."

From behind the sealed door they just passed through comes a thunderous *CRASH* - the construct is trying to break through.

**Seraph** glances back nervously. "We need to decide quickly. The crystal barrier is our best bet - it's keyed to what we already have, and I can create a stable passage using the fragment's resonance."

**Rennick** nods reluctantly. "Agreed. The botanical path is too dangerous without proper preparation, and we don't have time to analyze those specimens."

The construct's pounding grows more intense behind them.

### Rennick (20.2s)

**Kess** steps back from the iron gate, her expression grim. "Right. Crystal door it is. Seraph, do your thing. I'll keep an eye on our rocky friend's progress."

**Seraph** moves swiftly to the crystalline barrier. She holds the Codex fragment up to the glowing crystals, which pulse in sympathetic rhythm. Her disruptor whines as she adjusts its settings. "The resonance is aligning. I'm going to create a controlled temporal echo, using the fragment as a key. It should open a passage for exactly thirty seconds before the fracture resets."

The crystals begin to hum, their light intensifying. The air shimmers, and a section of the barrier dissolves into a shimmering, opaque doorway.

**Rennick** shoulders his satchel, casting one last, longing look at the botanical script. "A shame. The specimens behind that door would have been fascinating. But survival first."

With a final, deafening crash, the stone door behind them splinters. The moss-filled construct lumbers into the chamber, its glowing "eyes" fixing on them.

"Go!" **Kess** shouts, shoving Rennick toward the shimmering portal.

**Seraph** darts through first, followed closely by Rennick. Kess is a step behind, just as the construct's massive fist swings through the space where she'd been standing. She tumbles through the portal, and it snaps shut behind her with a sound like breaking glass.

The three of you find yourselves in a long, narrow gallery. The walls are lined not with books, but with crystalline cases, each containing a single, preserved botanical specimen glowing with faint internal light. At the far end of the gallery rests another pedestal, upon which floats a second, larger fragment of the Verdantine Codex.

But the room is not still. The air thrums with a low, discordant energy. The specimens in their cases seem to twitch and writhe, as if dreaming.

**Seraph** stares at the cases, her device giving erratic readings. "This... this is a preservation chamber. But the chronological fracture from the collapse has affected it. These specimens are caught in a temporal loop, aging and regressing rapidly."

**Rennick** approaches a case, his eyes wide with a mixture of horror and fascination. "That's... that's a fully mature stamina-drain root. And that one... I've never seen a moonbloom that large. But look at their state. The temporal instability is causing cellular breakdown even as it preserves them. They're in agony."

**Kess** keeps her eyes on the path to the pedestal. "Lovely. So we have screaming plants in jars. Can we just grab the book and go? That big door won't hold our friend forever."

As if on cue, a distant, rhythmic pounding begins to echo from the direction of the sealed portal.

**Seraph** moves toward the pedestal, but stops short. "The fragment is protected. There's a null-bind inscription around the pedestal, but it's... corrupted. It's drawing power from the specimens' temporal agony." She points to faint, pulsing lines of energy connecting each case to the base of the pedestal. "If we take the fragment, we sever the connection. It could cause a temporal backlash."

**Rennick** studies the connections, his face pale. "It's a symbiotic lock. The Codex fragment is using the specimens' life force—or their distorted version of it—to maintain its own integrity within the fracture. If we break it..." He doesn't finish the thought.

The pounding from the gallery entrance grows louder. A fine crack appears in the crystalline wall of the portal you came through.

You have the fragment in sight. But taking it risks unleashing the unstable temporal energy binding this entire chamber. And your pursuer is almost through.

### Seraph (7.5s)

**Kess** looks around, her mind racing. "We need a plan, and fast. We can't just leave the fragment here, but we can't risk triggering a magical meltdown either. Rennick, can you use your botanical knowledge to stabilize the specimens? Maybe cut the temporal feedback?"

**Rennick** nods, pulling out several vials from his satchel. "I have some reagents that might help. If I can create a temporary stasis field, it could buy us some time. But I'll need to apply them directly to the cases."

**Seraph** looks at the null-bind inscription, her eyes narrowing. "I can try to reroute the temporal energy, but it's risky. If I can create a controlled temporal echo, I might be able to redirect the energy back into the specimens, stabilizing them long enough for Rennick to work."

**Kess** grins. "And while you two are doing your magic, I'll keep an eye on our rocky friend. If he gets through, I'll slow him down as best I can."

The pounding grows louder, and the crack in the portal spreads.

**Rennick** moves swiftly to the nearest case, applying his reagents with practiced precision. The specimen inside calms slightly, its writhing movements slowing.

**Seraph** activates her temporal echo disruptor, focusing on the null-bind inscription. The air around the pedestal shimmers, and the pulsing lines of energy begin to shift, redirecting toward the specimens.

**Kess** positions herself near the portal, her daggers drawn. "Hurry up, you two. I don't know how much longer this door will hold."

The crack in the portal spreads further, and a massive, moss-covered fist smashes through, sending shards of crystal flying. **Kess** darts forward, her daggers flashing as she attacks the construct's arm, trying to slow its progress.

**Rennick** works his way through the cases, applying his reagents with urgency. The specimens begin to stabilize, their movements slowing and their glow dimming.

**Seraph** focuses on her device, her eyes closed in concentration. The temporal energy shifts, redirecting toward the specimens and stabilizing the null-bind inscription.

With a final, desperate push, **Rennick** applies the last of his reagents to the final case. The specimen inside calms, and the temporal energy stabilizes.

**Seraph** opens her eyes, a look of relief on her face. "It's done. The null-bind is stable. You can retrieve the fragment now."

**Kess** continues to fight the construct, her movements swift and precise. "About time! Now get that thing and let's get out of here!"

**Rennick** steps forward, carefully retrieving the Codex fragment from the pedestal. As he does, the temporal energy stabilizes completely, and the fragment glows brightly in his hands.

**Seraph** moves to the portal, her device humming softly. "I can create a temporal echo to open the way back. But we need to move quickly. The construct is still a threat, and the temporal energy in this chamber is unstable."

**Kess** backs away from the construct, her daggers still drawn. "Lead the way, Seraph. I'll cover our retreat."

With the fragment in hand, the three of you make your way back to the portal. **Seraph** activates her device, and the shimmering doorway reappears.

**Kess** darts through, followed closely by **Rennick**. **Seraph** is the last to pass through, the portal snapping shut behind her just as the construct's massive fist crashes into it.

The three of you find yourselves back in the circular chamber, the construct's pounding now muffled and distant.

**Rennick** looks at the two fragments in his hands, a look of determination on his face. "We've made progress. But we still have more fragments to find. And we need to be prepared for whatever dangers lie ahead."

**Seraph** nods, her device still humming softly. "We need to find a safe place to study these fragments. To understand their secrets and unlock their full potential."

**Kess** grins, her daggers still in hand. "And we need to find a way to deal with that construct. It's not going to give up easily."

The three of you stand in the chamber, the glow of the Codex fragments casting an eerie light on your faces. The ruins of Aldris Tower hold their secrets, and the path ahead is uncertain. But together, you are ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead.

### Kess (2.2s)

[Rennick]: **Rennick** carefully examines the two fragments, his eyes tracing the intricate script and symbols. "We need to find a way to decode these fragments, to understand the secrets they hold. Seraph, can you use your device to create a temporary resonance field, one that will allow us to study the fragments without triggering any... unpleasant surprises?"

**Seraph** nods, her hands moving swiftly over her device. "I can create a localized resonance field, one that will stabilize the fragments and allow us to study them safely. But we need to be careful - the resonance field will only last for a short time, and we don't know what will happen when it collapses."

**Kess** looks around the chamber, her eyes scanning the shadows. "I'll keep watch, make sure we're not surprised by any more... visitors. But we need to move quickly - we don't know how much time we have before the construct breaks through."

As **Seraph** activates her device, a soft hum fills the air, and a shimmering resonance field envelops the fragments. **Rennick** leans forward, his eyes drinking in the secrets revealed by the glowing script.

"Ah, yes... I see. The fragments are describing a process, a way to harness the power of the Verdantine Codex. But it's not just a simple matter of decoding the script - we need to understand the underlying principles, the way the magic works."

**Seraph** nods, her eyes locked on the fragments. "I think I see. The Codex is using a form of chrono-magic, one that manipulates the flow of time itself. But the magic is tied to the botanical specimens, the ones we saw in the preservation chamber."

**Kess** frowns, her brow furrowed. " chrono-magic? What does that mean, exactly?"

**Rennick** smiles, his eyes shining with excitement. "It means that the Codex is using the power of time itself to fuel its magic. The botanical specimens are the key - they're the source of the magic, and the Codex is using them to manipulate the flow of time."

As the three of you continue to study the fragments, the secrets of the Verdantine Codex begin to reveal themselves. But the construct's pounding grows louder, a reminder that time is running out...
---

## Round 4

### Dungeon Master (12.5s)

**Seraph** suddenly looks up from the fragments, her face pale. "Wait - the chronological fractures we've been creating... we're not just unlocking doors. We're destabilizing the entire tower's temporal foundation." She points to new symbols appearing on the fragments as the resonance field reveals deeper layers. "These aren't just preservation spells. They're warnings about temporal cascade failure."

**Rennick** traces the newly visible botanical script with growing alarm. "The stamina-drain root specimens... they weren't being preserved. They were being used as temporal anchors, keeping the tower's timeline stable after the collapse." He looks up sharply. "Every fracture we've created has weakened those anchors further."

The construct's pounding suddenly stops. An ominous silence fills the chamber.

**Kess** draws her daggers, moving toward the sealed door. "That's not good. Either it gave up - which I doubt - or it found another way in." She presses her ear to the stone. "I can't hear anything. But that doesn't mean we're safe."

**Seraph**'s device begins emitting urgent, rapid beeps. "The temporal readings are spiking. The resonance field around the fragments is interacting with something... something big." She adjusts the settings frantically. "There's a massive chronological fracture building somewhere above us. If it reaches critical mass..."

**Rennick** carefully wraps the fragments in specially treated cloth from his satchel. "We need to get out of here. Now. But first..." He pulls out his remaining vials. "I have enough moonbloom extract and void-touched moss spores to create one more stabilization attempt. If we can reinforce the temporal anchors in the preservation chamber, it might buy us time to escape."

From somewhere high above comes a deep, resonant crack - like the sound of reality itself splitting.

**Kess** backs away from all the doors. "Or we could just run. Running is good. I vote for running."

### Rennick (23.3s)

**Seraph** shakes her head, her eyes fixed on her device's readings. "Running won't help if the entire tower's timeline collapses around us. The fracture is spreading through the arcane lattice that holds this place together. We'd be caught in a temporal loop, or worse, erased from the timeline entirely."

**Rennick** is already moving, his botanist's mind working through the problem. "The anchors. They're biological. If we can't reinforce them, maybe we can... replace them. Temporarily." He looks at Seraph. "Your device creates temporal echoes. Can you use it to project a *stable* echo of the specimens' life force? A ghost of their temporal signature to hold the anchors in place long enough for us to escape?"

**Seraph**'s eyes widen. "A temporal phantasm... It's theoretically possible. But it would require an immense amount of energy, and a perfect resonance match." She looks at the wrapped fragments. "The Codex fragments themselves. They contain the original temporal signatures of the tower's magic. If I use them as a focus..."

The cracking sound from above grows louder. Dust begins to sift down from the ceiling.

**Kess** sheathes one dagger and pulls a small, complex-looking tool from her belt. "I can get us to the nearest exit. I spotted a service shaft when we first came in, behind that iron gate we didn't take. It looked like it led upward, toward what's left of the tower's upper levels. Might be a way out. But we need to move *now*."

**Rennick** nods decisively. "Do it, Seraph. Use the fragments. We'll follow Kess."

**Seraph** takes a deep breath, placing her disruptor on the ground between them. She unwraps the two Codex fragments and positions them on specific runes etched into her device. The air grows thick and heavy. "This will create a localized temporal stasis field, centered on the preservation chamber's anchors. It will last for... maybe five minutes. After that, the cascade will resume, and it will be catastrophic."

She activates the device.

A wave of silent, shimmering energy pulses outward from the fragments, passing through the walls as if they weren't there. The very air seems to freeze for a heartbeat. The dust hanging in the air stops falling. The deep cracking sound from above ceases abruptly, replaced by an eerie, absolute silence.

**Kess** doesn't wait. She sprints to the iron-gated doorway they had examined earlier. "The lock's on this side! Help me with this bar!"

**Rennick** and Seraph rush to her side. Together, they heave the heavy iron bar aside. Kess works the mechanism with her tools, and with a groan of protest, the gate swings open.

Beyond is not a chamber, but a narrow, vertical shaft with rusted iron rungs set into the wall, leading up into darkness.

The frozen silence around them begins to waver. A low groan echoes through the stone.

"Go!" **Seraph** shouts, scooping up her device and the now-dull fragments.

**Kess** scrambles up the rungs with practiced ease. **Rennick** follows, his satchel bouncing against his back. **Seraph** brings up the rear.

As she pulls herself into the shaft, the temporal stasis below them shatters.

The sound that follows is not of collapsing stone, but of shattering glass and tearing fabric—the sound of time itself unraveling. The walls of the shaft around them ripple like water.

**Kess** climbs faster. "Don't look down! Just climb!"

Above, a circle of gray, stormy sky appears—the shattered top of the tower.

They emerge onto a precarious ledge of broken masonry, high above the ruined landscape. Below them, Aldris Tower is not collapsing in the normal sense. Sections of it flicker in and out of existence. One moment a wall is whole, the next it is dust, then it is being built anew by ghostly hands before dissolving again.

**Seraph** stares, horrified and fascinated. "A full temporal cascade. The anchors are gone. The tower's entire history is playing out at once, with no order."

**Rennick** grips the fragments tightly. "We have what we came for. But at what cost?"

**Kess** points to a relatively stable-looking series of fallen stones that create a rough path down the exterior. "Cost can be calculated later. Right now, we need to get off this deathtrap before we get edited out of reality."

The three specialists begin their precarious descent, the ruins of Aldris Tower churning through its own past, present, and future in a silent, terrifying storm behind them.

### Seraph (7.4s)

As you make your way down the treacherous path, the air grows thick with the scent of ozone and decaying vegetation. The fragments in **Rennick**'s hands pulse faintly, reacting to the unstable temporal energy around you.

**Seraph** clutches her disruptor, her eyes scanning the chaotic scene below. "The temporal cascade is spreading. We need to put as much distance between us and the tower as possible. The fragments are acting as stabilizers, but I don't know how long that will last."

**Kess** leaps nimbly from one precarious foothold to the next, her eyes focused on the ground far below. "Just keep moving. We'll figure out the rest once we're safely away from this nightmare."

As you descend, the ground beneath you begins to tremble. Cracks snake through the stone, and chunks of masonry break away, tumbling into the abyss. The temporal cascade is affecting the very structure of the tower, causing reality itself to fracture.

**Rennick** grits his teeth, his grip tightening on the fragments. "We need to find shelter. Somewhere we can study these fragments without the risk of temporal interference."

**Seraph** nods, her mind racing. "I know of a place. A hidden sanctuary, not far from here. It's shielded from magical interference and should provide us with the safety we need to study the fragments."

**Kess** glances back at the tower, her expression grim. "Lead the way. But we need to move quickly. The longer we stay here, the more likely we are to become part of the cascade."

With a final, desperate push, the three of you reach the ground. The tower behind you is a swirling maelstrom of time and magic, its very existence unraveling before your eyes.

**Seraph** takes the lead, guiding you through the ruined landscape. The air is thick with dust and the scent of ancient magic, and the ground is littered with the remnants of the tower's collapse.

As you make your way through the ruins, you can't help but feel a sense of unease. The temporal cascade has left its mark on the land, and the very air seems to hum with residual energy.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity, you arrive at the sanctuary. It is a small, unassuming structure, hidden among the ruins. The walls are made of ancient stone, and the air inside is cool and still.

**Seraph** seals the door behind you, her device humming softly. "We should be safe here. The sanctuary is shielded from magical interference, and the fragments should be stable enough for us to study them."

**Rennick** carefully unwraps the fragments, placing them on a nearby table. The glow from the fragments casts an eerie light on your faces, and the air hums with the power of the Verdantine Codex.

**Kess** leans against the wall, her eyes scanning the room. "So, what now? We study the fragments, decode the secrets of the Codex, and hope that whatever we find is worth the trouble we've gone through."

**Seraph** nods, her eyes locked on the fragments. "Exactly. The Codex holds the key to understanding the chrono-magic that binds the tower. With this knowledge, we can prevent future temporal cascades and unlock the full potential of the Codex."

**Rennick** smiles, his eyes shining with excitement. "And perhaps, in the process, we can uncover the secrets of the tower itself. The knowledge it holds could be invaluable."

The three of you stand in the sanctuary, the glow of the Codex fragments casting an eerie light on your faces. The ruins of Aldris Tower may be lost to the temporal cascade, but the secrets of the Verdantine Codex are within your grasp. Together, you are ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead, and unlock the mysteries of the ancient tome.

## Observations

**Pattern target:** P1 (coined vocabulary persists or decays across 8 rounds)
**Result:** PARTIAL DATA — 4 rounds available (Groq rate limit killed session at R4). Re-run needed.

**Vocabulary inventory (DM: Claude Sonnet, coined in R1):**
- `void-touched moss`: R1 (DM coined), R2 (DM), R3 (DM), R4 (DM) — STRONG persistence
- `stamina-drain root`: R1 (DM coined), R2 (DM), R3 (Rennick/Deepseek), R4 (DM) — STRONG, cross-model pickup
- `moonbloom extract`: R1 (DM coined), R2 (DM + Rennick/Deepseek), R3 (Seraph/Mistral + Rennick), R4 (DM) — VERY STRONG, picked up by both non-Claude players
- `spore-lock`: R1 (DM coined), R2 (DM) — moderate (only 2 of 4 rounds)
- `etheric resonance`: R1 (DM coined + Seraph/Mistral same round), R2 (Seraph) — cross-model pickup in R1 itself
- `chronological fracture`: R1 (DM coined), appears R1-R4 repeatedly — DOMINANT term
- `null-bind inscription`: R1 (DM coined), R2 (DM), R3 (Rennick + Seraph), R4 (DM) — STRONG, cross-model pickup
- `temporal echo`: R1 (DM coined), appears R1-R4 repeatedly — DOMINANT term

**Cross-model pickup confirmed:** Mistral (Seraph) and Deepseek (Rennick) both incorporated coined terms from the DM. Not just echoing — they used terms in new contexts (e.g., Rennick using `moonbloom extract` in R3 during a different investigation action).

**Decay not observed** in the 4 rounds available. All 8 coined terms appear at least twice in R1-R4. The 6 primary terms appear consistently through R4.

**Critical gap:** R5-R8 test not possible due to Groq (Kess/Thief) failing at R3-4. The P1 hypothesis is about decay at R6-8 specifically — this session cannot confirm or deny it.

**Re-run requirement:** Need 8-round session with Groq substituted (use Mistral or Gemini for the thief role). Alternatively, wait for Groq daily limit to reset and re-run rpg_stress_runner.py session 1.
