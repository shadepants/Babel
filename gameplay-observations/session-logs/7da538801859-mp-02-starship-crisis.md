---

## Round 1

### Game Master (4.3s)

Dr. Pell pressed her face against the viewport, her breath fogging the reinforced glass. "A pre-contact structure... intact," she whispered, the words barely audible over the hum of the Ardent's engines. Her eyes, usually calm and analytical, were wide with an almost feverish intensity. "Six hours, Captain? That's barely enough time to scratch the surface, but we *have* to try. Think of the data, the sheer scientific goldmine! This could be the discovery of a lifetime, Commander. We can't let it just... drift away." She turned from the window, her gaze sweeping across the bridge, practically begging for agreement. "Engineer, can we get a closer spectral analysis? What's its composition? Any energy signatures beyond the broadcast?"

### Commander Rho (9.1s)

**Engineer Soto** looked up from his console, his weathered face grim as he studied the readouts. "Doc, I've been running scans for the past twenty minutes, and I don't like what I'm seeing." He tapped his display, highlighting several energy signatures. "That structure's got power conduits running through sections that look suspiciously like weapon emplacements. The broadcast frequency? It's pulsing in patterns - could be a targeting system, could be a warning beacon."

He stood, crossing his arms as he faced Dr. Pell. "You want to know about composition? It's made of materials our scanners can barely penetrate. Whatever built this thing had technology we don't understand. And you want to *dock* with it?" His voice rose slightly. "Captain, with all due respect to the Doc's scientific curiosity, I'm not putting this crew at risk for what could be an automated defense platform. We should maintain safe distance, take what scans we can, and report back to Command."

**Commander Rho** remained silent at her captain's chair, fingers drumming against the armrest as she weighed the heated exchange between her chief science officer and chief engineer. Her career hung in the balance either way.

### Engineer Soto (6.9s)

[Zara (NPC)]: The comms officer, Zara, a young but sharp-eyed ensign with a knack for pattern recognition, suddenly stiffened in her seat. Her fingers flew across her console, pulling up a secondary feed. "Commander, Engineer, Doctor—you need to see this." Her voice was tight, urgent.

She routed a visual to the main screen: the distress signal, now overlaid with a new data stream. "The broadcast isn’t just repeating a distress call. It’s *changing*. The frequency shifts every few minutes, but it’s not random. There’s a sequence here—like a countdown." She zoomed in on a section of the waveform. "If I’m reading this right, that structure isn’t just broadcasting. It’s *waiting* for something. And whatever it’s waiting for? It’s happening in five hours and forty-seven minutes."

She swallowed, glancing at Rho. "Captain, if we’re going to board, we need to decide *now*. The window to dock safely is closing fast, and if that thing is armed..." She trailed off, letting the implication hang in the air. "But if we don’t act, we might miss the only chance to find out what it wants."

### Dr. Pell (7.9s)

**Commander Rho** stopped drumming her fingers. The silence on the bridge became absolute, save for the low thrum of the ship's systems. She leaned forward, her eyes fixed on the main screen where Zara's data pulsed with cold, undeniable logic.

"Five hours and forty-seven minutes," she repeated, her voice flat. "A countdown to what? Activation? Self-destruct? A rendezvous?"

She swiveled her chair, her gaze sweeping from Pell's desperate hope to Soto's hardened skepticism. "Doctor, your scientific goldmine just got a timer. Engineer, your weapon platform is now a ticking clock. Both of you are right. And both of you are wrong."

She stood up, her posture rigid with command. "We are not docking. Not yet. Soto, I want a full passive sensor sweep on that countdown signal. Trace its source within the structure. Is it central, or is it coming from one of those 'weapon emplacements' you identified? Pell, you get your closer analysis. Work with Zara. I want every scrap of data on that broadcast's modulation. Is it a language? A system diagnostic? A warning siren? Use every non-invasive tool we have."

She turned back to the viewport, staring at the alien geometry silhouetted against the debris. "We have five hours and forty minutes to decide if that thing is a tomb, a treasure chest, or a trap. And we will decide with *data*, not desperation. Understood?"

Her eyes narrowed. "And Zara? Keep monitoring. The moment that signal pattern shifts again, I want to know. If it's waiting for something... we need to know what it thinks is coming."
---

## Round 2

### Game Master (3.1s)

Dr. Pell nodded sharply, her earlier urgency now channeled into a laser-like focus. "Understood, Commander." She spun on her heel, already moving towards Zara's console, her fingers practically twitching to get to work.

"Zara," she began, her voice low and intense, "Route every bit of that broadcast's modulation to my console. I want to build a profile – frequency shifts, amplitude variations, pulse duration... everything. We're looking for patterns, syntax, any kind of structure that suggests intent. Is it a language? A data packet? A beacon with a very specific message?"

Her eyes were glued to the main screen, where the alien structure loomed, its countdown ticking. "If it's waiting, it's communicating. And if it's communicating, we *can* decode it. Let's start with the basics – a full linguistic and mathematical analysis of that signal. We need to know what it's saying before that clock runs out." She pulled up a diagnostic interface on Zara's console, ready to dive in. "No invasive tools, Commander, just pure signal analysis. Let's see what this thing is trying to tell us."

### Commander Rho (9.3s)

**Engineer Soto** grunted his acknowledgment, already moving to the engineering station with practiced efficiency. "Aye, Captain. Running passive sensor sweep now." His thick fingers danced across the controls, years of experience guiding him through the complex array of detection systems.

The main display shifted to show a three-dimensional wireframe of the alien structure, with energy readings cascading down the side panels in streams of amber data. Soto's brow furrowed as he studied the readouts.

"Commander, the countdown signal... it's not originating from the weapon emplacements." His voice carried a note of grudging surprise. "It's coming from deep inside the structure's core - what looks like a central hub or command center." He highlighted the location with a red marker. "The power conduits I identified earlier? They're all feeding *into* this central point, not out from it."

He paused, running additional scans. "Captain, I'm also detecting micro-gravitational fluctuations around the structure. Whatever's powering that countdown, it's drawing energy from... somewhere else. The structure itself doesn't have enough internal power generation for what we're seeing."

Soto turned to face Rho, his expression troubled. "Ma'am, this changes things. If it's not a weapon platform... what the hell is it charging up for?"

### Engineer Soto (7.2s)

[Zara (NPC)]: Zara’s fingers flew across her console, cross-referencing Soto’s findings with the signal analysis she and Dr. Pell had been compiling. A sharp intake of breath cut through the tension on the bridge.

"Commander, the gravitational fluctuations—" She pulled up a side-by-side comparison, her voice tight with urgency. "They match the *pulse intervals* of the broadcast. It’s not just a countdown. It’s a *cycle*. The structure is siphoning energy from the debris field, but not randomly. It’s *selective*."

She highlighted a section of the waveform, zooming in on a repeating spike. "Every time the signal hits this marker, the gravitational pull intensifies around specific debris—metallic, high-density fragments. Like it’s *harvesting* them."

Her eyes flicked to Rho. "Captain, if this is a machine, it’s not just waiting. It’s *preparing*. And if we don’t act before that cycle completes—" She hesitated, then forced herself to finish. "We might not get another chance to find out what it’s building toward."

She swallowed hard, glancing at Soto. "Engineer, could those fluctuations interfere with docking? Or worse—could they *pull* us in if we get too close?"

### Dr. Pell (18.2s)

**Commander Rho** didn't move from her position, but her eyes tracked between the three displays: the structure's wireframe, the pulsing signal, and the gravitational map Zara had just overlaid. The pieces were starting to form a picture she didn't like.

"Harvesting," she said, the word tasting metallic. "It's not a distress call. It's a collection protocol. A machine calling home for spare parts."

She turned to Soto. "Answer her question, Engineer. Could it pull us in?"

Soto's hands flew over his console, running simulations. "At current intensity? No, Captain. We're well outside its effective gravitational envelope. But..." He pointed to a graph showing an exponential curve. "The energy draw is increasing with each cycle. If this rate holds, in approximately four hours and twenty minutes, its local gravity well could extend far enough to affect our station-keeping thrusters. We'd have to burn significant fuel just to hold position."

Rho's jaw tightened. "So we have a hard deadline before it becomes actively dangerous to remain. Doctor Pell." She turned her gaze to the xenobiologist. "Your analysis. Is this a language? A set of instructions? Or just a machine's shopping list?"

**Dr. Pell** looked up from her console, her expression a mix of awe and dread. "It's... both, Commander. The signal has a rigid, repeating mathematical structure—the countdown, the harvest markers. That's the machine protocol. But layered *underneath* it..." She enhanced a secondary audio channel. A low, harmonic hum filled the bridge, subtly different from the primary pulse. "...there's a carrier wave. Modulated, complex. It's not random noise. It has the signature of a compressed data stream. Possibly a log. A record."

She met Rho's eyes. "I think the machine is doing its job. But I also think something—or someone—left a message in the bottle. The real question isn't *what* it's building toward. It's *why*."

Rho stared at the alien structure, now looking less like a treasure chest and more like a dormant, hungry thing slowly waking up. The safe choice was to pull back, record from a distance, and let Command send a properly armed science team in six months.

But that message... and that clock.

"Options," she said, her voice cutting through the hum. "Soto. Could we send a probe? Something small, non-metallic, on a tether? Get close enough to scan that central hub directly without getting caught in the harvest cycle?"

Soto rubbed his chin. "Maybe. We have the Mark VII survey drones. Ceramic composites, minimal metal. We could program a slingshot trajectory, use the structure's own micro-gravity to swing it close for a high-res scan of that command center. But if the gravity spikes while it's in close..."

"It's a drone, not my crew," Rho finished for him. She looked at Pell. "If there's a data stream buried in that signal, could a close-pass scan potentially *retrieve* it? Before the cycle completes?"

Pell nodded slowly. "If we can get a clean read on the source emitter... yes. It's possible. We could attempt a direct data siphon."

Rho leaned on the command console, her decision crystallizing. "Then we don't board. Not yet. We send the probe. Soto, prep the Mark VII. I want it launched in thirty minutes. Plot a trajectory that gives us one close pass over that central hub, then slingshots it clear. Full sensor suite active. Zara, you and Pell work on the data siphon protocol. The moment that drone is in range, I want you trying to pull every byte of that buried signal."

She straightened up. "We're going to listen to that message. And then, with *that* information, we decide if we risk a docking, or if we get the hell out of its way before it finishes its shopping."
---

## Round 3

### Game Master (2.3s)

Dr. Pell's eyes lit up, a spark of pure scientific thrill overcoming the earlier dread. "A direct data siphon... excellent, Commander." She turned to Zara, her movements quick and decisive. "Zara, let's get that protocol ready. We'll need to optimize for burst data acquisition, given the limited window. Focus on filtering out the primary harvest signal and isolating that carrier wave."

She began pulling up schematics for the Mark VII drone's sensor suite. "If we can pinpoint the emitter's exact frequency and modulation, we can build a focused receiver profile. Think of it like tuning into a faint whisper in a hurricane. We'll only get one shot at this, so the parameters need to be perfect. Let's make sure we don't miss a single byte of that message." Her fingers were already flying across her console, preparing the necessary algorithms. "This is our chance to understand *why*."

### Commander Rho (9.9s)

**Engineer Soto** was already deep into the drone prep sequence, his movements efficient and methodical. "Mark VII prepped and loading trajectory calculations now, Captain." He pulled up a three-dimensional flight path on his display, showing the probe's planned route through the debris field.

"I'm programming a spiral approach - keeps it away from the densest metal fragments the structure seems to prefer. The ceramic composite should make it invisible to whatever harvesting protocol that thing is running." He paused, studying the gravitational data. "But Captain, there's something else. Those micro-gravitational pulses? They're not just pulling debris in random directions."

He highlighted several trajectory lines on the display. "The structure is *sorting* what it collects. Heavy metals get pulled toward one section, rare elements toward another. It's not just hungry - it's *selective*. Like it knows exactly what it needs for... whatever it's building."

Soto's weathered face was grim as he looked up at Rho. "Ma'am, if this thing is that sophisticated, there's a chance it might detect our probe despite the ceramic hull. The Mark VII carries trace amounts of rare earth elements in its sensor array. If that structure decides our drone looks tasty..."

He let the implication hang in the air. "Drone's ready for launch on your order, Captain. But we might only get one pass before it notices us."

### Engineer Soto (7.9s)

[Zara (NPC)]: Zara’s fingers hesitated over her console, her usual confidence wavering for a split second. "Commander, if the structure is sorting materials..." She pulled up a side-by-side comparison of the drone’s composition specs and the debris field’s harvest patterns. "The Mark VII’s sensor array *does* contain trace amounts of neodymium and dysprosium—elements the structure has been actively collecting."

She bit her lip, then forced herself to continue. "It’s a low concentration, but if the structure’s detection is sensitive enough..." She trailed off, glancing at Soto. "Engineer’s right. We might only get one clean pass before it flags the drone as a target."

She turned back to Rho, her voice steady despite the tension. "But if we don’t try, we lose the chance to hear that message. And if the structure *is* building something, we need to know what it’s planning before it finishes." She hesitated, then added, "Captain, if we’re going to do this, we need to launch *now*. The next harvest cycle starts in twelve minutes. If we time the drone’s pass just after the pulse, we might slip through undetected."

Her eyes flicked to the countdown. "Five hours and twenty minutes until the cycle completes. That’s our window. After that... we might not get another chance to listen."

### Dr. Pell (9.5s)

**Commander Rho** watched the data streams converge on her command display. The drone's composition, the harvest patterns, the ticking clock. A calculated risk was one thing. A blind gamble was another.

"Twelve minutes," she said, her voice cutting through the tension. "Soto, adjust the launch trajectory. I want the drone to ride the *edge* of that harvest pulse, not avoid it. Use the gravitational distortion as cover. If it's sorting, its attention will be on the primary debris stream, not a tiny anomaly on the periphery."

She turned to Zara and Pell. "Doctor, Ensign. Forget a clean data siphon. We're not tuning into a whisper. We're going to *shout back*."

Both scientists stared at her. Pell opened her mouth to protest, but Rho held up a hand.

"We transmit a compressed data packet on the same carrier frequency as the buried message. A handshake. A ping. Something simple, non-threatening, but unmistakably artificial. Mathematics. Prime numbers. The drone will broadcast it as it makes its pass."

She leaned forward, her eyes hard. "If that structure is just a dumb machine, it'll ignore us or treat us as noise. But if there's any intelligence behind that message—any awareness at all—it might *respond*. And that response will tell us everything we need to know about its intentions."

She looked at Soto. "Can the Mark VII handle a broadcast that powerful on short notice?"

Soto ran a quick diagnostic. "It'll drain the auxiliary power cells. We'll get one, maybe two bursts before it goes dark. But yes, Captain. It can be done."

"Then do it. Program the broadcast for the exact moment the drone is at its closest approach to the central hub. We ask our question when we're looking it right in the eye."

She turned back to the viewport. The alien structure hung against the stars, silent and enigmatic.

"We launch in ten minutes. We're not just listening anymore. We're knocking on the door. Let's see if anyone—or anything—answers."
---

## Round 4

### Game Master (4.2s)

Dr. Pell's eyes widened, a flicker of surprise quickly replaced by a fierce, almost exhilarated determination. "A handshake... Commander, that's audacious. And brilliant." She spun back to Zara, her fingers already flying across her console, overriding her previous data siphon protocols.

"Zara, new directive. We're not just receiving, we're transmitting. We need to generate a prime number sequence – a universal constant – encoded onto that carrier frequency. The drone's auxiliary power cells for the broadcast, Soto said? That means maximum power, minimal duration."

Her voice became a rapid-fire series of instructions. "We'll need to modulate the prime sequence to match the perceived 'language' structure we've been analyzing from the buried message. If it's listening, it needs to understand we're trying to speak *its* dialect, not just shouting static." She began configuring the drone's comms array for high-power, directional transmission.

"This isn't just a question, Commander. It's an introduction. And a challenge." She looked up, a glint in her eye. "We'll make sure our knock is loud enough to be heard, and clear enough to be understood. One shot. Let's make it count."

### Commander Rho (9.5s)

**Engineer Soto** grunted his acknowledgment, his hands moving with practiced precision as he reconfigured the Mark VII's systems. "Aye, Captain. Rerouting auxiliary power to the comms array now." Warning indicators flashed amber on his console as he pushed the drone's systems beyond their normal parameters.

"I'm installing a dead-man's switch on the broadcast system," he said, not looking up from his work. "If that structure decides to grab our drone with one of those gravitational pulses, the transmission cuts immediately. Last thing we need is to hand over our comm frequencies along with our hardware."

He paused, running final diagnostics on the modified drone. "Captain, I've got to ask - what if it doesn't just answer? What if our 'knock on the door' wakes something up that was better left sleeping?" His weathered face was etched with concern as he looked up at Rho. "That structure's been harvesting for who knows how long. If there's intelligence behind it, and we just announced ourselves..."

Soto's fingers hovered over the launch controls. "Drone's ready. All systems green, broadcast package loaded. But once we light this candle, there's no taking it back. Whatever's in there will know we're here."

He met Rho's eyes. "Your call, Captain. Launch in T-minus sixty seconds on your mark."

### Engineer Soto (7.9s)

[Zara (NPC)]: Zara’s hands trembled slightly as she double-checked the broadcast sequence one last time. The prime number sequence pulsed on her screen, a rhythmic pattern of human logic laid bare for something alien to decipher—or reject. She swallowed hard, her voice steady despite the weight of the moment.

"Transmission package locked, Commander. Prime sequence modulated to match the carrier wave’s structure. If it’s listening, it’ll hear us." She glanced at the countdown. "Harvest pulse in thirty seconds. Drone trajectory is optimal—it’ll skim the edge of the distortion field, just like you ordered."

Her eyes flicked to Rho, then to the viewport where the alien structure loomed, its surface now subtly shifting as the gravitational pulses intensified. "Captain, if this works... we might not just get an answer. We might get a *conversation*." She hesitated. "But if it doesn’t... we’ll know it’s not interested in talking."

She turned back to her console, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Either way, we’re about to find out if we’re alone in this system. Or if something’s been waiting for us to notice."

### Dr. Pell (17.0s)

**Commander Rho** stood perfectly still at the center of the bridge, her eyes fixed on the main screen. The drone's trajectory was a glowing green arc, a sliver of human intent aimed at the heart of the unknown. Soto's warning hung in the air, a cold, rational counterpoint to Pell's scientific fervor and Zara's tense hope.

"Waking something up is a risk," she said, her voice low and measured. "But so is letting a machine with unknown purpose finish building something in our space, with our resources. We are not just observers here. We are participants. And we need to know the rules of the game."

She turned her head, her gaze sweeping across her crew. "Doctor Pell is right. This is an introduction. Engineer Soto is right. It is a provocation. Both can be true. Our job is to be ready for the consequence."

Her hand came to rest on the command console. "Ensign Zara. On my mark, open a dedicated, isolated comms channel. Record everything. If we get a response, I want it quarantined and analyzed before it touches any other system."

She looked at Soto. "Launch the drone."

The engineer's hand came down on the controls. A soft thrum vibrated through the deck plates as the Mark VII detached from its external cradle. On the screen, the green arc began to crawl toward the alien structure.

"Drone away," Soto confirmed, his voice tight. "Approaching harvest pulse perimeter in three... two... one..."

The screen flickered as the drone entered the fringes of the gravitational distortion. The structure seemed to pulse, a slow, deep throb of invisible energy. Debris began to spiral inward.

"Broadcast window opening," Zara announced, her voice sharp with focus. "Prime sequence transmitting... now."

For a moment, nothing. The drone continued its silent, curving path. The structure continued its methodical harvest.

Then, the central hub—the source of the countdown—flared with a sudden, brilliant light.

Not a weapon discharge. A data burst. A torrent of raw information, screaming back along the exact frequency they had used.

It hit the drone like a physical blow. The feed dissolved into static, then reformed into a chaotic, overwhelming cascade of symbols, geometries, and what sounded like... voices. Hundreds of them, layered over one another, speaking in unison and in conflict.

Zara gasped, her hands flying to her ears as the audio spilled onto the bridge. "Captain! The response—it's not a signal, it's a *scream*! Multiple data streams, conflicting protocols—it's like a... a chorus!"

The main screen split. On one side, the drone's camera showed the central hub, its surface now alive with swirling, shifting patterns of light. On the other, the data stream scrolled too fast to read, but one repeating symbol was clear: a complex, recursive knot that seemed to signify both a question and a warning.

Soto stared at his console, his face pale. "The structure's power draw just spiked. It's stopped harvesting. It's reallocating all energy... to the central hub. Captain, it's not just answering. It's *focusing*."

Rho's knuckles were white where she gripped the console. The gamble had paid off. They had gotten a response.

Now they had to survive it.

"Zara, isolate and record everything. Pell, start decoding. Soto, bring the *Ardent* to full alert. Shields to standby. Be ready to burn hard on my command."

She watched the swirling lights on the hub, listening to the chaotic chorus of voices. "It's not a machine. And it's not alone. It's a *chorus*. And we just asked it to sing for us."

## Observations

## Observations

**Gemini Flash as DM runs lean and fast.** Setup turns were 2-4s vs. Claude DM's 8-10s. Less atmospheric prose, more plot-efficient scene framing. Works well for sci-fi noir where clinical efficiency fits the tone.

**Gemini Flash spontaneously created an NPC (Zara).** The comms ensign was not in the session config but Gemini introduced her in Round 1 and kept her consistent. Zara became a recurring voice that bridged the two camps (Soto skepticism vs. Pell enthusiasm). Good improvisational DM behavior.

**Claude (Commander Rho) drove every major narrative pivot.** The "we are not just observers, we are participants" line, the probe plan, the handshake-not-siphon pivot in Round 3 -- all player-initiated by Claude. Claude as a player character produces the most plot-advancing choices.

**Mistral (Engineer Soto) held the skeptic lane reliably.** Every response added a new risk or complication without blocking action. The "dead man's switch" detail in Round 4 was a nice original addition.

**Deepseek (Dr. Pell) matched enthusiasm to situation.** Started as excited scientist, became genuinely scared, then refocused as tactical. Emotional arc tracked the session's escalating danger appropriately.

**The session ended on an unresolved cliffhanger.** "We asked it to sing for us" -- naturally open-ended because RPG sessions don't conclude stories, they pause them. This is a good sign: the models understood their narrative role as participants, not resolvers.

**Cross-model coherence stayed high.** 3 different models playing characters with different emotional registers maintained a consistent setting, timeline, and set of shared facts across 4 rounds.
