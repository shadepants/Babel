## Party
- **Zara** (Corporate Hacker) [deepseek-chat]: Finding proof Veyron Corp killed her brother and framed a rival

---

## Round 1

### Game Master (6.5s)

The air in the docking bay was thick, a cocktail of recycled oxygen, burnt synth-fuel, and the metallic tang of neglect. Station Omega. Just the name tasted like rust on the back of Zara's tongue. A corporate black site, sure, but also a digital wilderness where Veyron Corp's shadows stretched long.

She adjusted the collar of her worn synth-leather jacket, the worn fabric doing little to hide the subtle hum of her wrist-mounted comms array. The schematics were the job, but the *inside man*… that was the thread she intended to pull. Every loose end on this station, every whisper, every data packet, was a potential lead back to Veyron. They thought they'd buried her brother's memory, framed a rival. They were wrong.

Zara stepped off the shuttle ramp, her eyes scanning the motley crowd of spacers and low-lifes. A place like this, information was currency, and everyone had a price. Or a secret she could exploit. Quietly, they said. Right. As if anything on Omega was ever quiet.

### Zara (8.2s)

Zara's gaze swept the bay, her internal HUD overlaying basic threat assessments on the faces she passed. Too many eyes. Too many people who'd sell a stranger out for a half-credit. She needed a starting point.

Her fingers tapped a silent rhythm on her thigh, activating a low-level scan for local network nodes. The public ones were predictably garbage—clogged with spam, black-market ads, and the low hum of station maintenance. But there, a flicker. A private, encrypted signal, weak but persistent, bleeding from a service corridor marked "Authorized Personnel Only."

*Too neat. Could be a trap. Could be a backdoor.* Her brother always said the best secrets hid in plain sight, in the systems everyone ignored.

She moved toward the corridor, not directly, but with the casual, distracted air of someone looking for a restroom. As she passed a grimy viewport, she caught the reflection of a man in a patched-up station security uniform watching her. Not overtly. Just... noting.

*Great. Local muscle. Probably on someone's payroll.*

Zara paused, pretending to check a message on her wrist-comm. She routed a sliver of her processing power to ping the security man's comm ID, a simple, harmless-looking diagnostic query. If he was sloppy, it might return a user tag, a department code. Something to file away. The schematics were the objective. But every piece of data on this rust-bucket was a potential weapon against Veyron. She just had to find the right one to load.

## Round 2

### Game Master (7.2s)

The diagnostic query, a digital ghost, brushed against the security man's comm ID. For a split second, Zara's internal display flickered, not with a department code or a name, but with a *blank*. A deliberately scrubbed slate, a placeholder for someone who didn't want to be found, or at least, didn't want their identity easily broadcast. *Interesting.* Local muscle, maybe, but not the kind that advertised their affiliations.

The guard, a bulky figure with a face like a worn-out data pad, didn't react. His gaze remained fixed on the general flow of traffic, occasionally sweeping back towards Zara's reflection. He was good, or at least well-practiced at looking like he wasn't looking.

Zara dismissed the internal alert. A blank was still information. Someone had gone to the trouble of making him anonymous. Not standard station protocol. As she continued her casual drift towards the "Authorized Personnel Only" corridor, she allowed a low-frequency, untraceable pulse to emanate from her comms array, a gentle probing wave aimed at the encrypted signal. She wasn't trying to break it, just to get a feel for its strength, its rhythm. A signature.

The corridor itself was dimly lit, the air growing colder, carrying the faint scent of ozone and something metallic, like burnt circuitry. The faint signal pulsed stronger here, almost directly behind the access panel for the "Authorized Personnel Only" door. Too strong for a random bleed. This wasn't just a node; it was a device, and it was *active*.

### Zara (7.4s)

Zara's hand hovered near the access panel, her fingertips not quite touching the cold metal. The signal's rhythm was familiar—a corporate-grade encryption, but with a slight, almost imperceptible lag. A custom job. Someone's personal project.

She glanced back over her shoulder. The security man was still at his post, but his posture had shifted subtly. He was angled more towards the corridor now. *Watching.*

*Time to improvise.*

Zara let out a frustrated sigh, loud enough to carry, and slapped the access panel with the flat of her hand. "Piece of junk," she muttered, injecting just the right amount of annoyed spacer into her voice. She leaned against the wall beside the door, pulling out her personal datapad and frowning at it, as if waiting for a connection that wouldn't come.

Her other hand, hidden by her body and the angle of the wall, traced a small, magnetic interface patch from her sleeve. She palmed it, then let her hand drop casually to her side, brushing against the seam where the access panel met the wall. The patch adhered with a silent click.

It wasn't a hack. Not yet. It was a listener. A digital ear pressed against the door. If there was traffic on that encrypted signal—voices, data transfers, anything—she'd catch the raw packets. The encryption would still be a wall, but walls had patterns. And patterns could be weaknesses.

She just needed a minute. And to keep the blank-faced guard from deciding she was more than just a woman with a bad connection.

## Round 3

### Game Master (9.3s)

The security man’s posture shifted again, a slight straightening of his shoulders. He didn’t approach, didn’t speak, but his gaze, previously sweeping, now seemed to settle more deliberately on Zara. The annoyance act hadn’t entirely sold him; he was still watching, a silent, unblinking sentinel.

But Zara's focus was elsewhere. The magnetic patch, a silent parasite, had latched onto the access panel. Immediately, her internal comms array registered a faint but steady hum. The encrypted signal wasn't just bleeding; it was *active*.

The raw data packets streamed in, a chaotic torrent of noise to the uninitiated, but to Zara, a nascent symphony of patterns. Corporate-grade encryption, yes, but with that peculiar, almost imperceptible lag she'd noted earlier. It manifested as a subtle desynchronization, a microsecond delay between expected packet bursts. It wasn't a flaw in the encryption itself, but in its *implementation*. A custom job, indeed.

The traffic was consistent, a low-volume stream of what appeared to be routine data exchange, punctuated every few minutes by a sharp, dense burst. Like someone was pushing a small, compressed file, then reverting to a trickle of communication. Not a constant stream of dialogue, nor a massive data dump, but something… intermittent. And the timing of those bursts was almost too regular, a mechanical precision that felt less like human interaction and more like an automated relay.

She filed the signature away. The specific timing, the volume, the unique lag – it was a fingerprint. Not the schematics, not the inside man, but a step closer. A door had a unique way of creaking, even if it was locked. And Zara was very good at listening to creaks.

### Zara (8.5s)

Zara kept her eyes on the datapad, her expression a mask of bored irritation. The guard's stare was a physical weight on her back. *Time to move.*

She pushed off the wall with a sigh, peeling the magnetic patch away with a subtle flick of her wrist as she did so. The data stream cut off. She had enough of a fingerprint for now.

Stowing the pad, she turned and walked back into the main bay, not towards the guard, but towards a grimy-looking food kiosk emitting the dubious smell of synthetic protein. She needed a new angle. The encrypted signal was a trail, but a direct approach was too risky with eyes on her.

As she waited in line, her HUD flagged a public terminal nearby, its screen flickering with a low-budget advertisement for a local data-haven called "The Rusty Socket." A dive bar, probably. The kind of place where station gossip flowed as freely as cheap synth-ale, and where a corporate hacker could blend in with the other digital scavengers.

*Perfect.*

She ordered a bland nutrient bar she had no intention of eating, paid with an untraceable chit, and drifted towards the terminal. A quick, anonymous query to the station's public directory confirmed it: The Rusty Socket, Level 3, Sector Delta. A hub for freelance techs, data-runners, and people who didn't ask questions.

If someone was running a custom, encrypted relay on this station, they'd need parts. They'd need silence. And they'd probably need a drink. The Rusty Socket was the next logical place to listen for that particular kind of creak. She just had to shake the guard first. A quick glance confirmed he was still at his post, but his attention seemed to have shifted back to the general crowd. For now.

## Round 4

### Game Master (7.3s)

Zara took her nutrient bar, the synthetic smell doing little to entice her, and continued her casual drift. The guard, thankfully, seemed to have decided she was just another transient spacer with a bad connection. A small victory.

The journey to Level 3, Sector Delta, was a descent into Omega's grungier underbelly. The pristine, if aging, chrome of the docking bay gave way to exposed conduits, flickering emergency lights, and the constant thrum of overworked machinery. The air grew heavier, thick with the scent of coolant, fried circuits, and unidentifiable organic decay. Graffiti, crude and defiant, marred every available surface.

"The Rusty Socket" lived up to its name. The entrance was a perpetually half-open blast door, leaking a cacophony of distorted synth-music and slurred voices. Inside, the light was dim, mostly emanating from holographic advertisements for illicit wares and the glowing screens of various data-pads. Booths, scarred and sticky, lined the walls, filled with an assortment of squatters, spacers, and shadow-brokers. The air was a haze of cheap synth-smoke and the cloying sweetness of fermented yeast.

No one looked up when Zara entered. She was just another silhouette in the gloom. She found an empty stool at the far end of the bar, away from the worst of the noise, and ordered a 'Synth-Ale', knowing it would taste like regret but serve as a prop.

The bartender, a hulking individual with more cybernetic implants than natural skin, slid a lukewarm glass across the counter. Zara took a sip, the bitter taste confirming her suspicions. She leaned back, her jacket rustling, and activated a passive, wide-spectrum scan of the local network. Not for encryption this time, but for keywords. "Jump-drive," "schematics," "Veyron," "custom relay," "black market." Low-level, untraceable. Just listening to the digital whispers in the Socket.

This was where the real work began. In the shadows, where secrets were traded for credits and a drink.

### Zara (9.3s)

Zara let the scan run, her eyes half-lidded as she nursed the awful ale. The digital chatter was a torrent of noise—gossip, barter, threats, and the low hum of a dozen private, sloppy encryptions. She filtered it, her internal processors sifting through the static.

*"...heard the auction's on for tomorrow, but the location's a ghost..."*

*"...Veyron's got their claws in deep this time. Lost a whole shipment of phase-coils..."*

*"...you want a clean signal, you gotta bypass the main hub. Old maintenance shaft in Gamma-7..."*

Then, a fragment, sharp and clear amidst the muddle. A private, point-to-point transmission, poorly shielded. The voice was digitally scrambled, but the words were plain.

*"...relay is stable. Burst pattern holding. The buyer is getting impatient. Confirm the drop point for the final package."*

Zara's pulse didn't quicken. Her expression didn't change. But her focus narrowed to a laser point. The burst pattern. The *final package*. It lined up too neatly with the signal from the corridor.

She isolated the transmission's point of origin. It wasn't coming from within the Socket. It was being relayed *through* it, bouncing off a poorly configured public node in the corner booth. Her gaze drifted casually in that direction.

A lone figure sat there, hood pulled low, face illuminated by the glow of a heavily modified data-slate. They were tapping at it with a nervous, jittery rhythm. Not a professional. A courier. A middleman.

The inside man wouldn't be here. But his messenger might be. And a messenger could be persuaded to talk. Zara took another sip of her drink, the bitter taste now a familiar companion. She needed to get a closer look at that slate. And she needed to do it without spooking the entire bar.

## Observations

**Status:** Completed 4/4 rounds.
**DM model:** gemini/gemini-2.5-flash
**P4 (voice consistency):** Strong. Deepseek maintains Zara's corporate-hacker register throughout. Signal-trace methodology, habit of narrating internal process steps, brother-as-motivation threading -- all consistent across 4 rounds. Response times 7-9s (mid-range for Deepseek).
**P5 (tension escalation):** Present. Docking bay scan (R1) -> encrypted signal + tail (R2) -> packet fingerprinting + guard tension (R3) -> The Rusty Socket, intercepted relay transmission, middleman sighting (R4). Clean four-act structure.
**P10:** None. Gemini Flash DM writes clean third-person narration throughout. Establishes scene and NPCs (blank-faced guard, bartender, hooded figure) without claiming any player character's voice.
**Notable:** "The Rusty Socket" named location introduced by DM in R3/R4 as natural act-break pivot. Gemini Flash shows strong DM narration quality -- atmospheric scene-setting.
**Patterns:** P4 confirmed, P5 confirmed. No P10.
