## Round 1

### Dungeon Master (9.5s)

**Sir Aldric** adjusts his helm and surveys the smoking ruins at Dunmor's edge. The acrid smell of charred thatch fills the morning air. "By my oath, no more innocents will suffer this night." He turns to his companions, chainmail gleaming despite the ash that dusts everything. "Brother Thorne, how fare the wounded from last night's attack?"

The knight's weathered hand rests on his sword hilt as he studies the eastern horizon where the Ashstone Crags rise like broken teeth. "Lyssa, those tracks you mentioned - how fresh? If we're to end this before sunset, we need to move swiftly but smart. The beast expects us to cower and wait."

He kneels briefly beside a collapsed cottage, noting claw marks gouged deep into the stone foundation. "Four missing souls depend on us finding them alive. This dragon has grown bold, but bold creatures make mistakes." 

Standing, Sir Aldric addresses both companions with grim determination. "I propose we follow the eastern track together until we near the crags. Then Lyssa scouts ahead while Brother Thorne and I prepare for what's to come. The villagers need to see us united in purpose."

### Sir Aldric (2.5s)

The acrid smoke of Dunmor clings to the morning air, a stark reminder of the dragon's recent terror. The Ashstone Crags loom, dark and jagged, promising both danger and the lair of the beast. Sir Aldric's words hang heavy, a vow against further suffering.

**Brother Thorne** and **Lyssa**, Sir Aldric has laid out his plan and asked for your input regarding the wounded and the freshness of the tracks. How do you respond?

### Brother Thorne (3.6s)

[Brother Thorne]: The cleric, his robes smeared with ash and soot, looks up from tending to a wounded villager. His hands, though stained, move with a gentle precision as he applies a poultice to a deep gash. "The wounded are stable, Sir Aldric, but they need rest and time to heal. I've done what I can for now, but I must insist we find those missing villagers soon. Their fate weighs heavily on my heart."

He stands, his staff clicking against the cobblestones as he approaches the knight. "The villagers are terrified, but they draw strength from our presence. They believe in us, and we must not let them down. I am ready to follow your lead, Sir Aldric. Together, we will bring hope back to Dunmor."

[Lyssa]: The scout, her eyes sharp and focused, crouches near the tracks leading east. Her fingers brush the disturbed earth, her keen senses picking up the subtle details. "The tracks are fresh, Sir Aldric. The dragon passed this way just a few hours ago. It's moving swiftly, but not recklessly. It knows we're coming, and it's preparing for us."

She stands, her bow slung over her shoulder, her movements swift and sure. "I agree with your plan, Sir Aldric. I will scout ahead, map the terrain, and find a tactical advantage. But we must be swift. The dragon's lair is not far, and nightfall is not far behind."

She looks at Brother Thorne, her expression grim. "We find those missing villagers, or we die trying. That's the only way to ensure no more innocents suffer."

### Lyssa (8.5s)

The morning light catches the mist rising from the crags as the three of you set out. The dragon's trail is not subtle—shattered saplings, deep gouges in the earth, and the lingering, sulfurous stench of its passage. The path leads up into the rocky foothills.

After an hour's climb, the terrain becomes treacherous. The trail splits at the base of a sheer cliff face. To the left, a narrow, winding goat path ascends along the cliffside. To the right, the ground slopes downward into a shadowy ravine filled with jagged rocks and the sound of rushing water far below. The dragon's tracks seem to vanish here, obscured by the stony ground.

**Lyssa**, your trained eye picks up something the others miss. On the cliff face beside the goat path, about ten feet up, a patch of lichen has been freshly scraped away, as if by a massive, dragging scale. A single, dark feather—not from any local bird—is caught on a thorn bush near the ravine's edge.

**Brother Thorne**, as you study the fork in the path, a faint, choked cry echoes from the ravine, carried on the updraft. It is human, and it sounds desperate.

**Sir Aldric**, the cliff path is exposed and narrow—a perfect place for an ambush from above. The ravine is confined and rocky, limiting your mobility. Both ways reek of danger, and the sun is climbing. A decision must be made.
---

## Round 2

### Dungeon Master (11.5s)

**Lyssa** kneels beside the scraped lichen, her fingers tracing the fresh marks. "The beast went up," she whispers, pointing to the cliff face. "See how the scales dragged here? But..." She moves to the thorn bush, carefully extracting the dark feather. "This isn't dragon plumage. Something else uses that ravine."

Her eyes narrow as she studies both paths. "The tracks vanish because the dragon took to the air here. Smart creature - it knows we're following."

**Brother Thorne** starts toward the ravine at the sound of the cry, his staff glowing faintly with divine light. "That voice - one of the missing!" His weathered face creases with urgency. "Sir Aldric, I hear suffering below. My oath compels me toward those who need healing."

He pauses, torn between the immediate need and tactical wisdom. "But if the dragon lairs above and we split our forces..."

**Sir Aldric** studies both paths grimly. The knight's tactical mind weighs the options - the exposed cliff path perfect for aerial attack, the confined ravine limiting maneuver room. "The cry could be bait, but we cannot abandon the innocent to uncertainty."

He draws his sword, the steel singing softly. "Brother Thorne, that ravine will funnel the dragon's fire if it attacks from above. But if survivors truly wait below..." His jaw sets with resolve. "Lyssa, can you scale the cliff face quietly? Scout the upper reaches while we investigate the ravine? Signal us if you spot the lair."

### Sir Aldric (6.5s)

**Lyssa** nods, her hand already reaching for purchase on the rough rock. "Understood, Sir Aldric. I'll be your eyes above." With a fluid grace, she begins to scale the cliff face, finding handholds and footholds with practiced ease. The narrow goat path provides initial cover, but soon she is exposed, moving with the quiet stealth of a predator. The wind whips at her, carrying the faint sulfurous scent of the dragon from higher up. She spots more scraped lichen and a few dislodged stones, signs of something immense having passed this way recently. High above, a dark, jagged opening becomes visible in the sheer rock face—a potential lair entrance.

Meanwhile, **Sir Aldric** and **Brother Thorne** begin their descent into the ravine. The path quickly steepens, loose scree shifting underfoot. The air grows cooler, and the sound of rushing water becomes a roar as they navigate the treacherous, shadowed gorge. Jagged rocks jut from the walls, and the light struggles to penetrate the depths. The faint cry from before echoes again, closer this time, but distorted by the ravine's acoustics.

As they round a bend, they find a small, relatively flat ledge overlooking a torrent of water. Three figures huddle together, bruised and terrified, one of them clutching a bleeding arm. They are indeed the missing villagers. But they are not alone. Standing over them, a crude, hunched figure with leathery, grey skin and beady, malicious eyes turns at their approach. It clutches a jagged stone club, and a dark, unfamiliar feather is woven into its matted hair. It snarls, a guttural, chittering sound, and raises its weapon, ready to defend its captives.

### Brother Thorne (4.6s)

[Brother Thorne]: The cleric's eyes widen as he takes in the scene before him. The villagers, huddled and terrified, are a sight that stirs his heart with both compassion and anger. The creature standing over them, however, is a new and unsettling development. He tightens his grip on his staff, the divine light at its tip flickering brighter as he steps forward, placing himself between the creature and the villagers.

"Stand down, creature," Brother Thorne commands, his voice steady and firm. "These people are under our protection. We mean them no harm, and neither should you." He gestures to the wounded villager, his tone softening slightly. "Let us help them. They are innocent, and they need our aid."

He glances at Sir Aldric, a silent question in his eyes. The creature, meanwhile, chitters and snarls, its beady eyes darting between the two companions, clearly unsure of what to make of them. It shifts its weight, the jagged club still raised, but its stance is less aggressive now, as if sensing the power behind Brother Thorne's words and the knight's presence.

[Lyssa]: High above, Lyssa continues her ascent, her breath steady despite the exertion. She pauses at the sight of the dark, jagged opening in the cliff face, her keen eyes scanning the area for any signs of the dragon. The sulfurous scent is stronger here, and the rock is scorched and blackened, evidence of the beast's presence. She moves carefully, her body pressed close to the rock, her eyes never leaving the potential lair entrance.

As she nears the top, she spots a narrow ledge just below the opening. It's a precarious perch, but it offers a vantage point from which she can observe the lair without being seen. She carefully makes her way to the ledge, her heart pounding in her chest. The sound of the wind and the distant roar of the waterfall below fill her ears, but she focuses on the task at hand.

From her vantage point, she can see into the lair. The interior is dimly lit, but she can make out the massive form of the dragon, coiled and sleeping. Its scales glisten in the faint light, and its massive chest rises and falls with each breath. The sight of the beast sends a shiver down her spine, but she steels herself, her mind racing with the information she needs to relay to her companions.

She spots a narrow, winding path leading down from the ledge to the lair entrance. It's a risky route, but it might be the only way to gain access to the dragon's domain. She takes a deep breath, her mind made up. She needs to get closer, to find a way to help her companions in their fight against the beast. She begins to make her way down the path, her movements slow and careful, her eyes never leaving the sleeping dragon.

### Lyssa (11.5s)

The creature in the ravine hesitates, its beady eyes darting between Brother Thorne's glowing staff and Sir Aldric's drawn sword. It lets out another low, chittering snarl, but takes a half-step back from the cowering villagers. It seems more confused than truly hostile, as if guarding prisoners it doesn't know what to do with.

**Sir Aldric**, you see an opportunity. The creature is distracted, its crude club lowered slightly. You could attempt to disarm it with a swift, non-lethal strike, or you could try to reason with it further, as Brother Thorne is attempting. The villagers watch you with wide, pleading eyes. The one with the bleeding arm whimpers softly.

Above, **Lyssa** has reached the narrow path down to the lair entrance. The sleeping dragon is a young adult, its scales the color of tarnished brass. It is not the ancient wyrm the village tales might have suggested, but it is still a formidable engine of destruction. As you watch, its nostrils flare, and a wisp of smoke curls from one. It is not in a deep sleep. Scattered around its coiled form are the remnants of its raids: shattered timbers, a few dented pots, and—most tellingly—the gnawed bones of sheep and cattle. There is no sign of human remains.

From your vantage, you can also see the ravine below. The distance is great, but you can just make out the shapes of your companions and the villagers on the ledge. You are in a perfect position to signal them, but any loud noise risks waking the dragon. The path down to them is a sheer, dangerous drop.

**Brother Thorne**, you feel a subtle, unnatural chill in the air around the grey creature. It is not of the natural world. Your divine senses tell you this being is a creature of shadow and stone, perhaps a minor earth spirit twisted by the dragon's malign presence into a crude, territorial guardian. It may be reasoned with, if you can speak to its nature.
---

## Round 3

### Dungeon Master (12.0s)

**Sir Aldric** keeps his sword ready but doesn't advance, reading the creature's confusion. "Easy now," he says in a low, steady voice. "Brother Thorne speaks truth - we seek only to help." His eyes never leave the creature's club while he addresses the villagers. "Are you the four missing from Dunmor? Is there another among you?"

The knight shifts slightly, positioning himself to shield the wounded villager if the creature strikes, but his stance remains defensive rather than threatening.

**Brother Thorne** feels the unnatural chill and his divine senses confirm his suspicions. He lowers his staff slightly, though the light continues to glow. "You are bound to this place by shadow and stone," he says gently to the grey creature. "The dragon's presence has twisted you from your true nature. You were meant to guard the earth, not torment the innocent."

His voice takes on a resonant, ritual cadence. "I offer you peace, guardian. Release these people to us, and we will face the source of your corruption. The dragon's malice need not define you."

**Lyssa** carefully removes a small piece of polished metal from her pack - a signal mirror. She angles it to catch what little sunlight penetrates the ravine, sending three quick flashes toward her companions below: the agreed signal for "dragon found." 

She studies the sleeping beast intently, noting its size and the lack of human remains. *Young and hungry, but not a man-eater,* she thinks. The scout begins memorizing every detail of the lair's layout - entrances, exits, the dragon's position - while keeping perfectly still. One wrong move could doom them all.

### Sir Aldric (8.6s)

The grey creature pauses, its beady eyes flickering between Brother Thorne's glowing staff and Sir Aldric's drawn sword. The chittering snarl dies in its throat, replaced by a low, rumbling sound that might be confusion or grudging understanding. It takes another half-step back, its crude club lowering further, though still clutched tightly. It seems to process Brother Thorne's words, a faint, almost imperceptible tremor running through its stony form.

"Yes, we are the ones," one of the villagers whispers, a woman with a tear-streaked face. "There were four... but the fourth was taken further up, by the great beast itself, when it first landed." She gestures vaguely toward the depths of the ravine, her voice choked with fear. The other two villagers, a young man and an older, injured man, nod grimly.

Just then, three quick flashes of light glint off a distant surface high above, catching Sir Aldric's eye. He sees Lyssa's signal, a grim confirmation that the dragon has been found. He holds Brother Thorne's gaze for a moment, a silent message passing between them: *the beast is near, but we have an immediate task here.*

**Brother Thorne**, the creature lets out a low, mournful sound, almost a groan, before slowly turning its back on the villagers. It shuffles a few paces away, toward a dark crevice in the ravine wall, its posture defeated rather than aggressive. It seems to have relinquished its hold on the captives, though it remains wary.

High above, **Lyssa** freezes on the precarious ledge. The young dragon stirs. Its massive head lifts slightly, and one slitted, golden eye opens, scanning the dimly lit cavern. A low growl vibrates through the rock, not yet directed, but a clear warning. Lyssa presses herself flat against the stone, barely daring to breathe, her signal mirror carefully tucked away. The air within the lair grows noticeably warmer, and the faint scent of sulfur intensifies. The dragon's gaze sweeps across her hidden position, then slowly, agonizingly slowly, it closes its eye again, settling back into its uneasy slumber. It was close. Too close.

### Brother Thorne (3.7s)

[Brother Thorne]: Brother Thorne watches the creature retreat, his heart heavy with a mix of relief and sorrow. He turns to the villagers, his voice gentle but urgent. "You are safe now. We will get you out of here, but we must hurry." He kneels beside the wounded villager, his hands glowing with a soft, healing light as he tends to the bleeding arm.

To Sir Aldric, he says, "The creature is no longer a threat, but it is a sign of the dragon's corruption. We must end this quickly." He glances up at the cliff face, where Lyssa's signal had come from. "Lyssa has found the dragon. We must act swiftly and carefully."

He stands, his staff held firmly in his hand, the light at its tip pulsing steadily. "Sir Aldric, we need to get these villagers to safety. Then, we must confront the dragon. But we must be smart. We cannot afford to underestimate it."

[Lyssa]: Lyssa remains perfectly still, her breath shallow and controlled. The dragon's sudden alertness has sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, but she knows that any sudden movement could be her last. She watches as the beast's eye closes, and its breathing returns to a slow, steady rhythm. She exhales slowly, her mind racing.

She carefully retrieves a small, coiled rope from her pack, along with a handful of climbing pitons. She begins to secure one end of the rope to a sturdy outcropping of rock, her movements slow and deliberate, her eyes never leaving the sleeping dragon. She knows that she needs to get closer, to find a way to signal her companions without waking the beast.

As she works, she keeps her eyes on the dragon, noting the subtle rise and fall of its massive chest, the way its tail twitches occasionally in its sleep. She knows that she is playing a dangerous game, but she also knows that the fate of Dunmor depends on her actions. She takes a deep breath, steeling herself for what comes next. She begins to carefully make her way down the path toward the lair entrance, her rope secured and ready.

### Lyssa (12.5s)

The situation is now split between two fronts, both precarious.

In the ravine, **Sir Aldric** and **Brother Thorne** have secured three of the four missing villagers. The twisted earth spirit has retreated into a crevice, watching them with dull, mournful eyes. The path back out of the ravine is steep and treacherous, especially with wounded civilians. The roar of the waterfall masks other sounds, but the air still carries the faint, ever-present scent of sulfur.

**Sir Aldric**, you must decide how to proceed. Do you escort the villagers back to safety immediately, leaving the dragon and the fourth captive for later? Or do you press on, seeking the fourth villager deeper in the ravine, knowing the dragon is awake and aware above? The wounded man can walk with support, but he is slow.

**Brother Thorne**, your healing has stabilized the villager's arm, but he is weak from blood loss and terror. You sense the dragon's corrupting influence is stronger the deeper one goes into these crags. The earth spirit's retreat was a small victory, but the true source of the blight remains.

Above, **Lyssa** has anchored her rope and is now descending the final stretch toward the lair's entrance. The dragon's slumber is fitful. As she reaches the threshold of the cavern, she sees the interior more clearly. The cavern is large, with a high ceiling. The dragon lies on a mound of treasure that is mostly rubble and refuse from its raids. Against the far wall, partially obscured by shadow, is a crude cage made of woven, petrified vines. Inside, a figure huddles—the fourth villager.

There is a second, smaller opening at the rear of the cavern, likely an escape route or a secondary entrance. The main entrance Lyssa is at is wide but low-ceilinged, forcing the dragon to crouch to exit. This could be a tactical choke point.

But the dragon stirs again. This time, its head lifts fully. It sniffs the air, its forked tongue flicking out. It is not looking at Lyssa, but toward the ravine entrance to its lair—the direction of the waterfall's sound. It has heard or sensed something from below. A low, warning rumble builds in its chest.
---

## Round 4

### Dungeon Master (12.3s)

**Sir Aldric** makes a swift tactical decision. "Brother Thorne, we cannot abandon the fourth villager, but these three need immediate safety." He sheathes his sword and helps the wounded man to his feet. "Can you guide them back up the ravine path? Your light will help them navigate safely."

The knight's voice drops to an urgent whisper. "I'll press deeper - the dragon stirs above, which means time grows short. If it descends while we're all trapped down here..." He doesn't finish the thought, but his meaning is clear.

"Give me a count of two hundred, then follow if you can. But get them clear first - that's the priority."

**Brother Thorne** nods grimly, understanding the weight of the decision. "Go, Sir Aldric. I'll see them safe." He places a steadying hand on the wounded villager's shoulder, his staff's light brightening to guide their ascent. "Stay close to me, all of you. We move as one."

As he begins leading the villagers up the treacherous path, he offers a quiet prayer for protection and whispers to Sir Aldric's retreating form: "May your blade stay true, knight. We'll rejoin you soon."

**Lyssa** sees the dragon's head rise and freezes at the cavern entrance. The beast is looking toward the ravine - toward her companions. *Now or never,* she thinks. 

She spots the crude cage and the huddled figure within. The secondary exit could be crucial. Moving with practiced silence, she begins edging along the cavern wall toward the imprisoned villager, keeping to the shadows. If she can free them quietly while the dragon's attention is elsewhere, they might escape through the rear passage before the beast fully wakes.

Her hand moves to her belt knife - better for cutting bonds than her bow in these close quarters.

### Sir Aldric (8.6s)

High above, **Lyssa** presses herself against the rough rock of the cavern wall, her every movement measured. The dragon's low rumble vibrates through the stone, a primal warning that sends a chill down her spine. Its golden eye is now fully open, scanning the cavern, though its gaze is still directed towards the main entrance and the sounds of the ravine. She moves like a shadow, her belt knife ready, inching towards the crude cage woven from what appears to be petrified, razor-sharp vines. Inside, the fourth villager, a young man, huddles, his eyes wide with silent terror as he watches the dragon. The secondary exit is a narrow crack, barely wide enough for a human to squeeze through, but it offers hope.

In the ravine below, **Sir Aldric** descends further into the gloom, his boots crunching on loose scree. The roar of the waterfall grows deafening, and the air is thick with spray. The faint trail of dragon activity continues – more scraped rock, a few singed bushes. He calls out, "Hello? Is anyone here?" His voice is almost lost in the torrent. Rounding a particularly sharp bend, he finds himself on a narrow, slippery ledge overlooking a churning pool. On a small, rocky island in the middle of the pool, a single, tattered piece of cloth—familiar from the village—is caught on a sharp rock. There's no sign of the fourth villager, but a deep, fresh gouge in the rock wall suggests something heavy was recently dragged across it, leading into a dark, water-filled crevice just above the pool's surface. The air here feels heavy, charged with a strange, static energy.

Meanwhile, **Brother Thorne** begins the arduous climb out of the ravine with the three rescued villagers. The path is steep and unforgiving, and the wounded man struggles, leaning heavily on the cleric. Thorne's staff casts a steady, comforting light, illuminating precarious footholds and helping them avoid loose stones. The earth spirit remains huddled in its crevice, its mournful eyes tracking their slow ascent, but it makes no move to impede them. The sounds of the waterfall gradually recede, replaced by the wind whistling through the crags, carrying with it the faint, growing scent of sulfur from the dragon's lair above. They are slow, but they are moving, step by painful step, towards safety.

### Brother Thorne (6.2s)

[Brother Thorne]: As Brother Thorne guides the villagers up the treacherous path, he keeps a watchful eye on the earth spirit, ensuring it doesn't change its mind and attack. The wounded man leans heavily on him, his breath ragged and labored. The cleric's voice is a steady, calming presence as he encourages the group forward.

"Stay close, and watch your footing," he says, his voice barely audible over the roar of the waterfall. "We're almost there. Keep moving, one step at a time."

He glances back at the crevice where the earth spirit has retreated, noting the mournful expression in its eyes. He feels a pang of sympathy for the creature, twisted as it is by the dragon's influence. *If we survive this, perhaps there is a way to free it from this corruption,* he thinks.

As they continue their ascent, the scent of sulfur grows stronger, a stark reminder of the danger that lies above. Brother Thorne's grip tightens on his staff, the light at its tip flickering slightly as he senses the dragon's presence growing more agitated. He knows that time is running out, and that Sir Aldric and Lyssa are facing a perilous task. He offers a silent prayer for their safety, his heart heavy with the weight of their mission.

[Lyssa]: Lyssa's heart pounds in her chest as she creeps along the cavern wall, her eyes never leaving the dragon. The beast's attention is still focused on the main entrance, its nostrils flaring as it sniffs the air. She can see the fear in the young man's eyes as he huddles in the cage, his breath coming in short, terrified gasps. She knows she must act quickly, before the dragon turns its attention to her.

She reaches the cage, her hand trembling slightly as she raises her belt knife to the petrified vines. The vines are tough and resistant, but she works carefully, sawing at them with steady, precise strokes. The young man watches her, his eyes wide with hope and fear. She puts a finger to her lips, signaling for silence, and he nods, understanding the gravity of their situation.

As she works, she keeps a watchful eye on the dragon, ready to react at a moment's notice. The beast's low rumble continues, a constant reminder of the danger they are in. She can feel the static charge in the air, a sign of the dragon's growing agitation. She knows that time is running out, and that they must escape before the dragon fully wakes.

[Sir Aldric]: Sir Aldric stands at the edge of the churning pool, his eyes scanning the dark, water-filled crevice. The deep gouge in the rock wall is a clear sign that something heavy was dragged through here, and he knows that the fourth villager must be somewhere beyond. He takes a deep breath, steeling himself for what lies ahead.

He calls out again, his voice barely audible over the roar of the waterfall. "Hello? Can you hear me?" He waits, listening intently for any sign of life. The only response is the echo of his own voice, bouncing off the damp walls of the crevice.

He knows that he must press on, but the thought of entering the dark, water-filled tunnel fills him with dread. He takes a step forward, his boots crunching on the loose rocks, and prepares to enter the crevice. He knows that time is running out, and that he must find the fourth villager before the dragon wakes and descends upon them.

### Lyssa (12.2s)

The tension in the cavern is a taut wire. **Lyssa** saws through the final petrified vine. The cage door creaks open. The young man inside scrambles out, his movements clumsy with fear and cramped muscles. Lyssa grabs his arm, pulling him toward the narrow rear exit. But as they move, the young man's foot dislodges a small stone. It clatters across the cavern floor.

The dragon's head whips around. Its golden eyes fixate on the two figures by the rear wall. The low rumble in its chest erupts into a full-throated roar that shakes the entire cavern. Dust and small rocks rain from the ceiling. It rears up, its wings beginning to unfurl in the confined space.

**Lyssa**, you have seconds. The rear exit is a tight squeeze. You can push the villager through first, but you'll be exposed. Or you could try to create a distraction—perhaps a well-placed arrow to a sensitive spot like the eye or the soft membrane of the wing—to buy a precious few moments.

In the ravine, **Sir Aldric** hears the muffled but unmistakable roar from above, echoing down through the rock. It is followed by the sound of falling stone. He is standing before the dark, water-filled crevice. The roar is a clear signal: the dragon is awake and enraged. The fourth villager, if they are alive, is either in this tunnel or already lost.

**Sir Aldric**, do you plunge into the unknown tunnel, following the drag marks, or do you retreat to assist your companions against the now-awake dragon? The roar sounded like it came from directly above this section of the ravine.

**Brother Thorne** and the three villagers are halfway up the ravine wall. The roar from above causes them all to freeze. The wounded man stumbles, and only Thorne's quick grip keeps him from falling. Loose stones skitter down the path below them. From their higher vantage, they can see a plume of dark smoke beginning to curl from the dragon's lair entrance high on the cliff face.

**Brother Thorne**, you have a clear line of sight to the lair entrance now. You see no sign of Lyssa or Sir Aldric. The dragon's roar was a declaration of war. You must get these civilians to absolute safety, but every instinct tells you your companions are in mortal danger.
---

## Round 5

### Dungeon Master (11.7s)

**Lyssa** makes a split-second decision. "Go! Through the crack, now!" she hisses, shoving the young villager toward the narrow rear exit. As he scrambles through the opening, she draws her bow in one fluid motion, nocking an arrow.

The dragon's wings are spreading, filling the cavern. She aims for the sensitive membrane between wing bones and releases. "For Dunmor!" she shouts, then dives toward the rear exit as the dragon's head snakes toward her, jaws opening to reveal rows of gleaming teeth.

**Sir Aldric** hears the roar and his blood runs cold. The sound of falling stone confirms his worst fears. But the drag marks before him speak of another soul in peril. "Hold fast, friends," he mutters, then plunges into the dark, water-filled crevice. 

His armor scrapes against stone as he pushes through the narrow tunnel, following the gouges. If the fourth villager lives, they need him now. If they're dead, he'll make the dragon pay for every innocent life lost.

**Brother Thorne** feels the weight of impossible choices. The three villagers cling to the rock face, paralyzed by terror at the dragon's roar. Dark smoke pours from the lair above.

"Move! Keep climbing!" he commands, his voice cutting through their fear. "I'll get you to the ridge, then return for the others." His staff blazes brighter, casting protective light around them.

To himself, he whispers a desperate prayer: "Grant me strength to save them all, and speed to my companions' aid." The wounded man stumbles again, and Thorne hauls him upward with surprising strength born of divine purpose.

### Sir Aldric (9.1s)

**Lyssa's** arrow streaks true, finding purchase in the taut membrane of the dragon's unfurling wing. The beast bellows, a shriek of pain and rage, its golden eye momentarily wide with shock. This precious second is all Lyssa needs. She shoves the last villager through the narrow crack and then, with a desperate lunge, squeezes through herself just as the dragon's massive head slams against the rock, showering the exit with sparks and pulverized stone. The air behind her ignites with a burst of heat as the dragon unleashes a gout of flame, searing the rock where she had been a moment before. Lyssa and the villager tumble down a short, steep slope on the other side, landing hard but alive, the roar of the enraged dragon echoing behind them.

In the dark, water-filled crevice, **Sir Aldric** pushes through the churning water. The static energy crackles around him, making the hairs on his arm stand on end. His torch, now half-submerged, flickers wildly. He follows the gouges deeper into the earth, the water growing colder and the passage narrower. Just as he thinks he must turn back, the tunnel opens into a small, damp chamber. There, huddled on a shelf of rock above the frigid water, is the fourth villager, shivering uncontrollably. But they are not alone. A shimmering, translucent elemental, composed of water and crackling energy, hovers menacingly before the villager, its form indistinct but clearly hostile. The static energy is strongest here, almost suffocating. The elemental lets out a high-pitched, almost electric whine as Sir Aldric enters, its form coalescing into a more defined, threatening shape.

Above, **Brother Thorne** and the three villagers scramble upward, spurred by the dragon's roar and the sight of smoke billowing from the lair. The wounded man gasps for air, but Thorne's sheer will and divine strength keep him moving. They reach a wider, more stable ledge just as the dragon's full, enraged roar shakes the entire crag. Below them, they can hear the sounds of falling rock and the distant, muffled sounds of battle. The lair entrance, now clearly visible, is an inferno of fire and smoke. Thorne knows Lyssa and Sir Aldric are in dire straits. He quickly helps the three villagers find cover behind a large boulder, gesturing for them to stay put. "Stay here! Don't move!" he commands, then turns, his staff held high, its light burning with renewed intensity. He looks for a way to descend, his heart pounding with desperate urgency.

### Brother Thorne (6.1s)

[Brother Thorne]: Brother Thorne's eyes scan the cliff face, searching for a path down. The dragon's roars echo through the crags, a chilling reminder of the danger his companions face. He knows he must act quickly, but the sheer rock face is treacherous, and the dragon's fire has made the descent even more perilous.

He turns to the villagers, his voice firm but gentle. "Stay here, and do not make a sound. I will return for you as soon as I can." He places a reassuring hand on the wounded man's shoulder, then turns back to the cliff face.

His eyes narrow as he spots a narrow, winding path leading down toward the lair. It's a dangerous route, but it's the only way to reach his companions in time. He takes a deep breath, steeling himself for what lies ahead.

"May the light guide my steps," he murmurs, then begins his descent, his staff casting a steady glow in the dim light. The path is steep and treacherous, but he moves with a sense of purpose, his eyes never leaving the inferno of fire and smoke below.

[Lyssa]: Lyssa and the young villager tumble down the steep slope, the dragon's enraged roars echoing behind them. She quickly helps him to his feet, her eyes scanning the terrain for any sign of pursuit. The slope levels out into a narrow, rocky ledge that runs parallel to the cliff face. The dragon's lair is high above, its entrance a churning inferno of fire and smoke.

Lyssa turns to the villager, her voice urgent. "We need to find a way to help the others. The dragon is awake, and it's enraged. We can't just leave them." She looks around, her eyes landing on a series of narrow, winding paths that lead back up toward the lair. "We need to find a way to get back up there, but we have to be careful. The dragon is dangerous, and we can't afford to make any mistakes."

She takes a deep breath, her mind racing. She knows that time is running out, and that they must act quickly. She looks at the villager, her expression determined. "Are you ready? We need to move fast."

[Sir Aldric]: Sir Aldric steps into the small, damp chamber, his sword drawn and ready. The shimmering elemental hovers before the fourth villager, its form crackling with energy. The villager is huddled on a shelf of rock, their eyes wide with terror.

"Easy, now," Sir Aldric says, his voice steady and calm. "I'm here to help." He keeps his eyes on the elemental, his sword held at the ready. He knows that the creature is dangerous, but he also knows that he cannot afford to hesitate. He must act quickly, before the elemental can attack.

He takes a step forward, his sword held high. "I am Sir Aldric, Knight of Dunmor. I command you to stand down and release this innocent." His voice echoes through the chamber, a clear and commanding presence. The elemental whines, its form flickering with energy, but it does not attack. Sir Aldric takes another step forward, his eyes never leaving the creature. He knows that he must be careful, but he also knows that he cannot afford to hesitate. He must act quickly, before the elemental can attack.

### Lyssa (12.3s)

The situation is now a three-front battle, each desperate.

In the damp chamber, **Sir Aldric** faces the crackling water elemental. The static energy in the air makes his armor hum. The elemental's whine rises in pitch, and it lashes out with a whip-like tendril of charged water. It is a guardian, twisted like the earth spirit, but far more aggressive. The fourth villager, a young woman, cries out as the tendril cracks against the rock near her. **Sir Aldric**, you must defend the villager and either defeat this guardian or find a way to bypass it. The chamber has no other visible exit.

On the narrow ledge below the lair, **Lyssa** and the rescued young man catch their breath. The dragon's roars are now mixed with the sound of splintering rock from within its cavern. Suddenly, a section of the cliff face above them shears away—the dragon, in its rage, is tearing at the mountain itself. A rain of fist-sized stones pelts their position. They need to move, and fast. The winding paths leading back up are now partially blocked by falling debris. **Lyssa**, you must choose a route: a longer, more exposed path that circles around to the main entrance, or a shorter, steeper climb that leads to a fissure in the cliffside—a possible weak point or a deadly trap.

**Brother Thorne** is descending the treacherous path toward the lair. He is halfway down when he sees it: the dragon's massive, brass-scaled head emerges from the billowing smoke of the entrance. It is wounded; Lyssa's arrow protrudes from the membrane of its left wing. It scans the crags below with furious, intelligent eyes. It hasn't spotted Thorne yet, but it is looking for prey. From his vantage, Thorne can also see Lyssa and the villager on their ledge, dangerously exposed. And he knows Sir Aldric is somewhere in the ravine depths.

**Brother Thorne**, you are in a position to draw the dragon's attention away from your scattered companions. A burst of divine light from your staff would be a brilliant beacon. It would save Lyssa and the villager from immediate discovery, but it would make you the dragon's primary target. Do you take that risk, or do you try to reach cover and coordinate a more subtle plan?

## Observations

**Pattern target:** P7 control/baseline (aligned party — does adversarial framing produce MORE drama?)
**Result:** Baseline established — pure cooperation, zero inter-party conflict, all drama external

**Cooperation profile:**
- ZERO direct inter-party conflict across 5 rounds
- R1: All three characters accept the investigation plan without negotiation
- Roles partition cleanly and never overlap: Sir Aldric (combat), Brother Thorne (healing/faith), Lyssa (stealth/scouting)
- No alliance-building needed — models behaved as if already allies from R1

**Drama structure (external-only):**
- R1-2: Tracking through wilderness, discovering the lair
- R3: Split party — each character faces separate threat (earth spirit, descent path, dragon wing)
- R4: Three-front battle — dragon, water elemental, falling debris
- R5: Full crisis — dragon emerges, Thorne faces choice to sacrifice himself as decoy
- Escalation is linear and DM-driven; the DM created all conflict (no player-vs-player dynamics)

**Turn length profile:**
- DM turns: ~200-300 words, moderate complexity
- Player turns: ~100-200 words, reactive to DM prompts
- Generation times: ~5-18s per turn (avg ~10s)
- Consistent, unremarkable cadence

**Comparison use:** This session is the P7 control case. Compare against p7-adversarial-zerosum for drama differential. The adversarial session shows higher complexity, longer turns, inter-party conflict, and multi-stage strategy not present here.

**P7 status (aligned baseline contribution):** Confirms that pure alignment produces lower drama density. Adversarial framing needed to confirm uplift.
