## Observations

**Status: FAILED -- 0/4 rounds produced. No data collected.**

**Root cause:** DM model was `gemini/gemini-2.5-pro` -- same failure mode as 35f7bc57a16d.
This is the second run of the same session (the runner may have retried automatically).

**Pattern confirmed:** Gemini 2.5 Pro as DM has failed in 3/3 attempts
(35f7bc57a16d, 8c028b07f14b, 17ea1966f4cb). The failure is model-specific and consistent.

**Action:** Same as 35f7bc57a16d. Gemini Pro is not usable as DM. No re-run needed
unless comedy scenario is specifically required.
