---

## Round 1

### Dungeon Master (3.6s)

(Elara carefully examines the small vial of toxin residue, holding it up to the light from the window.) "The molecular structure is... unnaturally stable. This isn't some crude poison. It's engineered. Whoever created this has access to alchemical equipment and knowledge." (She turns to Sir Valor.) "The physician said the Chamberlain's body showed no outward signs of struggle. Which means he either trusted his killer... or didn't see the threat coming."

### Sir Valor (9.5s)

**Sir Valor** adjusts his disguise as an estate auditor, his jaw tightening at Elara's analysis. "If the Chamberlain trusted his killer, we're looking at someone with established access and authority. The new Chamberlain would be the obvious suspect - convenient timing for an appointment." He pauses, considering. "But cultists are cunning. They often place their agents in positions of trust long before striking."

He looks toward the window overlooking the gardens where Sera walks among the roses. "We need to establish who had regular contact with the deceased Chamberlain in his final days. Ashwood, can you observe the staff's routines without drawing attention? I'll approach this systematically - starting with Lord Valdris himself. If there's corruption in this house, it may reach higher than we think."

**Sir Valor** straightens his ledger and quill. "Elara, that toxin analysis could be our key. If you can determine where such alchemical knowledge might be acquired, we can narrow our suspects considerably."

### Elara (2.9s)

[Dungeon Master]: As Sir Valor speaks, a soft knock echoes at the door. A servant's voice filters through, "Pardon the interruption, auditors. Lord Valdris requests your presence in his study at your earliest convenience."

The gardens below seem serene, Sera Valdris humming a soft tune as she tends to her roses. The new Chamberlain is nowhere to be seen, but the estate physician is seen exiting the infirmary, his brow furrowed in thought.

Elara's analysis of the toxin reveals a peculiar property: it's designed to mimic natural decay, making it nearly undetectable in an autopsy. The alchemical signature is unique, but not unheard of. "This toxin... it's not from any known apothecary in the region," Elara murmurs. "Whoever created this has access to rare ingredients and advanced techniques. We're looking for someone with both knowledge and resources."

Ashwood, if you're to observe the staff's routines without drawing attention, you might consider blending in with the servants or finding a vantage point where you can see the comings and goings of the household. The estate is large, but there are patterns to the staff's movements, especially around mealtimes and when Lord Valdris or his daughter require attendance.

Sir Valor, approaching Lord Valdris could provide valuable insights, but be cautious. The lord is known to be sharp and perceptive. He might see through your disguise if you're not careful. How do you proceed?

### Ashwood (0.8s)

[Ashwood]: Ashwood nods silently to Sir Valor, understanding the task. He slips out of the room, blending into the background as he makes his way to a lesser-used corridor, seeking a spot to observe the staff's movements without being noticed. He finds a small alcove near a window, partially hidden by a tapestry, where he can watch the comings and goings of the household staff, taking note of anyone who seems out of place or exhibits unusual behavior.

As he settles into his vantage point, he keeps a keen eye on the doors to the infirmary, the study, and the gardens, watching for any interactions between the staff members, Lord Valdris, or his daughter Sera, looking for patterns or anything that might seem suspicious.
---

## Round 2

### Dungeon Master (5.3s)

(Ashwood watches from his alcove as the estate physician, a man named Dr. Thorne, pauses in the hallway, glancing furtively in both directions before slipping a small, dark vial into his coat pocket. He then proceeds toward the gardens, where Sera Valdris is still tending her roses.)

Meanwhile, in the study, Lord Valdris awaits. He is a man in his late fifties, with sharp eyes and an air of weary authority. The room is lined with books and ledgers. He gestures for Sir Valor to take a seat.

"Your audit comes at a troubled time," Lord Valdris says, his voice low. "My late Chamberlain was a good man. His death... it feels wrong. I trust you will be thorough in your examination of the household accounts?" His gaze lingers on Sir Valor, as if searching for something beyond the ledger.

### Sir Valor (15.4s)

**Elara** carefully seals the toxin sample and tucks it into her satchel. "I need to examine the infirmary - if this compound was prepared on-site, there may be residual traces or equipment." She pauses, watching through the window as Dr. Thorne approaches Sera in the gardens. "That's... interesting timing."

She turns to Sir Valor before he leaves for the study. "Be careful with Lord Valdris. His phrasing suggests he suspects foul play but doesn't know who to trust. That could make him either our greatest ally... or most dangerous obstacle if he believes we're the threat."

**Elara** moves toward the door, planning to investigate the infirmary while the physician is occupied in the gardens. "I'll search for alchemical equipment or ingredient traces. If Dr. Thorne is our cultist, he'd need a laboratory space - and the infirmary would be perfect cover for acquiring and preparing toxins."

She glances back at the others. "Signal if Lord Valdris becomes suspicious. We may need to accelerate our timeline."

### Elara (4.6s)

[Dungeon Master]: As Elara makes her way to the infirmary, she notices that the door is slightly ajar, as if someone had left in a hurry. Inside, the room is tidy, but a faint, acrid scent lingers in the air. The infirmary is well-stocked with herbs and basic medical supplies, but Elara's keen eye spots a small, hidden compartment beneath a cabinet. Inside, she finds remnants of alchemical work: a stained mortar and pestle, a few vials of unknown substances, and a journal with hastily scribbled notes.

Meanwhile, in the gardens, Dr. Thorne approaches Sera Valdris. "My lady," he says, his voice low, "I must speak with you about your father. His health has been... concerning me. I believe he may be in danger."

Back in the study, Lord Valdris watches Sir Valor closely. "You seem familiar with the ways of the world, auditor," he comments. "Have you encountered situations like this before? A man in my position must be cautious, but I cannot afford to be blind to threats within my own home."

Ashwood, from his vantage point, sees Dr. Thorne and Sera enter a secluded part of the gardens, their conversation too quiet to overhear. The physician's body language is tense, and Sera's expression is one of concern.

Elara, what do you make of the alchemical equipment and notes you've found? Do you recognize any of the substances or the handwriting? Sir Valor, how do you respond to Lord Valdris's probing? And Ashwood, do you notice anything else amiss in the household staff's behavior? The day is wearing on, and time is of the essence.

### Ashwood (0.9s)

[Ashwood]: Ashwood's eyes narrow as he watches Dr. Thorne and Sera Valdris slip into the secluded part of the gardens. He notices that one of the senior staff members, a tall, imposing man with a stern expression, lingers near the garden entrance, his gaze fixed on the pair. The staff member's behavior seems almost... protective, as if he's watching over Sera.

Ashwood's attention is drawn to the staff member's hands, which are clenched into fists, betraying a hint of tension. He wonders if this staff member might be more than just a curious observer, perhaps someone who is also investigating the strange occurrences within the household. Ashwood makes a mental note to keep an eye on this staff member, as their behavior could be a valuable clue in unraveling the mystery.
---

## Round 3

### Dungeon Master (7.1s)

(Elara carefully examines the journal, her fingers tracing the hurried script. The notes are fragmented, but she recognizes references to 'nightshade extract,' 'grave moss,' and 'essence of void-touched crystal'—all components of the corruption-toxin. More disturbingly, there are several entries detailing observations of Lord Valdris's 'declining constitution' and 'increased susceptibility.' The handwriting matches the physician's formal medical logs she saw earlier.)

(She pockets a small sample of the residue in the mortar, her mind racing. Dr. Thorne isn't just a suspect—he's actively monitoring the lord, possibly preparing another dose. The journal suggests the toxin works slowly, mimicking natural decay. The Chamberlain's death might have been a test, or a removal of an obstacle.)

Back in the study, Lord Valdris's gaze remains fixed on Sir Valor. The lord's hand rests on a heavy ledger, but his attention is clearly elsewhere. "Well?" he prompts, his tone edged with impatience. "I asked if you've seen such situations before. My household feels... unbalanced since the Chamberlain's passing. Even my daughter seems distant."

### Sir Valor (7.9s)

**Sir Valor** meets Lord Valdris's gaze steadily, choosing his words with care. "In my experience, my lord, sudden deaths often reveal fractures that were already present in a household's foundation." He opens his ledger, using the motion to buy a moment's thought. "Financial irregularities frequently accompany... other irregularities. Trust, once broken, spreads like rot."

He leans forward slightly, lowering his voice. "You speak of your daughter seeming distant. Has she formed any new... associations recently? Sometimes grief makes us vulnerable to those who would exploit our pain." His hand rests near his concealed holy symbol. "If you suspect danger to your family, my lord, perhaps we should discuss this more directly. An audit can reveal many things beyond mere numbers."

**Sir Valor** watches Lord Valdris's reaction carefully, trying to gauge whether the man can be trusted with the truth—or if he's already compromised. "Tell me, who recommended your new physician? And when did he join your household?"

### Elara (3.0s)

[Dungeon Master]: Lord Valdris's expression darkens at Sir Valor's insinuation, but he doesn't react with anger. Instead, he seems to consider the question carefully. "Dr. Thorne was recommended by a colleague in the capital," he admits. "A man I've known for years, though I've never met the physician himself. Thorne arrived just before the Chamberlain's death. I... I trusted the recommendation. But now..." He trails off, his gaze drifting to the window, where the gardens are visible.

In the gardens, Sera Valdris and Dr. Thorne are still deep in conversation. Sera's expression is one of distress, and she clutches a handkerchief tightly. Dr. Thorne's posture is rigid, his voice too low to hear, but his gestures are urgent. The senior staff member who Ashwood noticed earlier shifts his weight, his fists still clenched, but he makes no move to approach them.

Elara, you realize the journal in your hands could be crucial evidence. Do you confront Dr. Thorne directly, or do you continue your investigation, perhaps searching for more clues in the infirmary or elsewhere in the estate? Sir Valor, Lord Valdris awaits your response. Do you press him further about Dr. Thorne, or do you suggest a different course of action? And Ashwood, do you approach the senior staff member to gather more information, or do you continue observing from a distance? The tension in the household is palpable, and time is running out.

### Ashwood (1.1s)

[Ashwood]: Ashwood decides to approach the senior staff member, trying to appear nonchalant as he walks towards the garden entrance. He clears his throat to announce his presence, not wanting to startle the staff member. "Excuse me," Ashwood says, trying to sound friendly and curious. "I'm one of the auditors. I couldn't help but notice you seem to be keeping an eye on the gardens. Is everything all right?"

Ashwood's gaze drifts towards Sera and Dr. Thorne, trying to gauge the staff member's reaction to the pair's intense conversation. He's looking for any sign of loyalty, concern, or perhaps even suspicion towards the physician. By engaging the staff member in conversation, Ashwood hopes to gather more information about the household dynamics and potentially uncover any secrets that might be hidden in plain sight.
---

## Round 4

### Dungeon Master (10.6s)

(The senior staff member turns sharply, his stern expression softening slightly at Ashwood's approach. He is a man in his late forties, with the bearing of a former soldier. His name, you recall from the household roster, is Gregor, the head of household security.)

"Auditor," Gregor says, his voice low and measured. He glances back toward the gardens, then at Ashwood. "Everything is... as it should be. Lady Sera often takes counsel with the physician regarding her father's health." He pauses, his jaw tightening. "Though I must admit, I find the timing of these consultations... concerning. The physician has been unusually attentive since the Chamberlain's passing."

He leans in slightly, his voice dropping to a near-whisper. "Between us, I've seen him in the east wing at odd hours. The old chapel there has been sealed for years, but I've heard... chanting. And the air grows cold." Gregor's hand drifts to the hilt of his belt knife. "I've served House Valdris for twenty years. I don't trust this new physician. But without proof, what can I do?"

In the study, Lord Valdris's eyes narrow at Sir Valor's question. "Dr. Thorne arrived precisely three weeks ago. My colleague's letter praised his... 'unconventional methods' for treating chronic ailments." The lord's fingers drum on the ledger. "You think he's involved? If so, we must act carefully. My daughter is with him now."

Elara, from the infirmary window, you can see Ashwood speaking with Gregor near the garden entrance. Dr. Thorne and Sera are still in their secluded spot, but the physician is now gesturing toward the main house, as if urging her to go inside.

### Sir Valor (9.1s)

**Elara** quickly closes the journal and tucks it into her satchel along with the residue samples. The evidence is damning - Dr. Thorne has been preparing toxins and monitoring Lord Valdris's health like a predator stalking prey. 

She moves swiftly to the infirmary window, catching sight of Ashwood's conversation with Gregor and the physician's urgent gestures toward Sera. Her analytical mind pieces together the timeline: three weeks ago Thorne arrived, the Chamberlain died shortly after, and now he's isolated with the lord's daughter.

**Elara** exits the infirmary and moves purposefully toward the gardens, her hand resting on a small vial of neutralizing agent she always carries. She approaches the group at a measured pace, calling out in her most professional tone:

"Dr. Thorne! How fortuitous. As part of our estate audit, I need to review the medical supplies inventory. The infirmary seems to be missing several standard compounds from its manifest."

She positions herself where she can see both Sera and the physician clearly, ready to intervene if needed. "Lady Sera, perhaps you could assist? Your father mentioned you have an excellent eye for detail."

**Elara** watches Thorne's reaction carefully, looking for any sign of panic or aggression that might confirm her suspicions.

### Elara (5.4s)

[Dungeon Master]: Dr. Thorne turns sharply at Elara's voice, his expression a mask of professional calm, though his eyes betray a flicker of something darker. "Ah, Auditor," he says smoothly. "I was just ensuring Lady Sera's well-being. She's been under considerable stress lately." He gestures to Sera, who looks up, her eyes red-rimmed but alert. "Of course, we must cooperate fully with the audit."

Sera nods, stepping forward. "I'd be happy to assist, Auditor. The infirmary's records are quite thorough." She glances at Dr. Thorne, her expression unreadable. "Though I'm sure Dr. Thorne has been meticulous in his record-keeping."

Gregor, watching from the garden entrance, subtly shifts his stance, his hand still near his belt knife. He gives Ashwood a barely perceptible nod, as if to say, "Be ready."

Lord Valdris, still in the study with Sir Valor, leans forward. "You suspect Dr. Thorne," he states, his voice low. "But why? What evidence do you have?" His eyes search Sir Valor's face, seeking answers.

Dr. Thorne's gaze flicks between Elara and Ashwood, then to Gregor. He seems to be calculating, his professional demeanor slipping for just a moment. "The infirmary is at your disposal, Auditor," he says, his voice tight. "I have nothing to hide."

Sir Valor, Lord Valdris awaits your response. Do you reveal your suspicions about the toxin and the journal, or do you continue to probe for more information? Elara, how do you proceed with your investigation, now that you've engaged Dr. Thorne directly? And Ashwood, do you continue your conversation with Gregor, or do you join Elara in the infirmary? The tension is palpable, and the household's secrets are beginning to unravel.

### Ashwood (1.4s)

[Sir Valor]: **Sir Valor** leans forward, his voice taking on a serious tone. "My lord, I believe Dr. Thorne's arrival and the Chamberlain's death are more than just coincidental. The toxin found in the Chamberlain's body is a rare and sophisticated compound, one that suggests a level of expertise and resources beyond a simple household physician."

He pauses, studying Lord Valdris's reaction. "Furthermore, I've reason to believe that Dr. Thorne has been monitoring your health, my lord, and possibly manipulating your medications. The question is, what is his ultimate goal?" Sir Valor's hand rests on the hilt of his sword, a subtle gesture of readiness.

"I propose that we investigate Dr. Thorne's background and connections, my lord. If he is indeed involved in the Chamberlain's death, we must take immediate action to protect you and your household." Sir Valor's eyes lock onto Lord Valdris's, seeking his trust and cooperation in uncovering the truth.

Meanwhile, Sir Valor is aware of the unfolding scene in the gardens and the potential for danger. He is prepared to act swiftly if necessary, to protect Lady Sera and the others from Dr. Thorne's possible machinations.

## Round 5

### Dungeon Master (8.0s)

(Lord Valdris rises from his chair, his face pale but resolute. "If what you say is true, then my daughter is in danger with him now." He moves toward the study door, his hand trembling slightly. "I will confront him myself—")

Before he can finish, a sharp cry echoes from the gardens. Through the window, you see Sera stumble back, clutching her throat. Dr. Thorne has a small, dark vial in his hand, its contents now empty. "Forgive me, my lady," he says, his voice cold and detached. "But your father's corruption must be cleansed, and you... you were becoming inconvenient."

Gregor draws his knife with a snarl, but Thorne raises his other hand, muttering words in a guttural tongue. Shadows seem to coil around his fingers.

In the gardens, Elara recognizes the symptoms immediately—the same toxin, but accelerated. Sera collapses to her knees, gasping for air.

**Time for action.** The cultist has revealed himself, but the ritual may already be in motion. The old chapel Gregor mentioned—that must be where the dark work is being completed.

### Sir Valor (8.7s)

**Sir Valor** doesn't hesitate. "The chapel - that's where the ritual is!" He draws his sword, its blade gleaming with holy light as his paladin training takes over. "Lord Valdris, get to safety!"

He charges toward the gardens, calling out as he runs: "Elara! The neutralizing agent - now! Ashwood, with Gregor - stop those shadows!"

**Sir Valor** raises his blade high, channeling divine energy. "By the light that banishes darkness, I compel you - release the girl!" His voice booms with righteous authority as he attempts to disrupt Thorne's shadow magic with a burst of radiant energy.

**Elara** immediately pulls out her neutralizing agent, rushing to Sera's side. "Hold on, Lady Sera!" She administers the antidote while analyzing the accelerated toxin's effects. "The compound is moving faster - we need to get her to clean air and keep her conscious!"

She shouts to the others: "The ritual isn't complete! If we can disrupt whatever he's doing in that chapel and neutralize this toxin, we can save both her and Lord Valdris!"

**Ashwood** moves swiftly alongside Gregor, drawing his own blade. "The east wing chapel - lead the way! We end this cult's work today!"

### Elara (6.4s)

[Dungeon Master]: (Sir Valor's divine intervention disrupts Thorne's shadowy magic, the dark tendrils dissipating as the paladin's radiant energy washes over the garden. Thorne snarls, his eyes flashing with dark energy, but he is forced to step back, his ritual interrupted.)

(Elara administers the neutralizing agent to Sera, who gasps as the antidote takes effect. The toxin's effects begin to recede, though she remains weak. "Thank you..." she whispers, her voice hoarse. "My father... he's in danger...")

(Dr. Thorne, seeing his plans unraveling, snarls and turns to flee toward the east wing. "Fools! You cannot stop the will of the Void!" he shouts, his voice echoing unnaturally. Gregor and Ashwood give chase, their weapons drawn.)

(Inside the old chapel, the air is thick with a palpable sense of dread. The room is adorned with dark symbols and flickering candles, their flames burning an unnatural green. At the center of the room, a ritual circle is drawn in blood, with Lord Valdris bound and unconscious at its heart. A dark, swirling vortex hovers above him, pulsing with malevolent energy.)

(Dr. Thorne reaches the chapel, his hands raised to resume the ritual. "The master's power will cleanse this house of its corruption!" he cries, his voice echoing with dark energy. The vortex above Lord Valdris begins to pulse faster, the air growing colder and heavier.)

(Elara, having stabilized Sera, rushes to join the others, her mind racing to find a way to disrupt the ritual. She pulls out her alchemical kit, her eyes scanning the symbols and the vortex for any weakness.)

(Sir Valor, his sword still glowing with holy light, charges into the chapel, his voice booming with divine power. "Release Lord Valdris, and your ritual ends now!")

(Dr. Thorne turns to face Sir Valor, his eyes burning with dark energy. "You dare interfere with the master's will?" he growls, his hands raised to unleash a wave of shadowy energy.)

(Gregor and Ashwood flank Thorne, their weapons ready. "We've got your back, auditor," Gregor growls, his knife glinting in the eerie light.)

(Elara, her eyes locked on the vortex, quickly analyzes the ritual. "The vortex is a conduit for the Void's energy," she calls out. "If we can disrupt the symbols or the circle, we can break the connection!")

(The chapel is filled with tension and the hum of dark energy. The fate of House Valdris hangs in the balance. What do you do?)

### Ashwood (1.4s)

[Ashwood]: Ashwood takes advantage of the distraction caused by Sir Valor's charge and Dr. Thorne's response. He darts to the side, attempting to flank Thorne and get closer to the ritual circle. His eyes are fixed on the symbols etched into the floor, looking for any weakness or pattern that Elara can exploit to disrupt the ritual.

As he moves, Ashwood calls out to Elara, "What do you need to break the connection? Do you need me to take out any specific symbols or disable a particular part of the circle?" He readies his blade, preparing to strike at the ritual circle or take down Dr. Thorne if necessary.

Meanwhile, Gregor positions himself to take on Dr. Thorne, his knife at the ready. "I've got this one, Ashwood. You focus on disrupting the ritual." He eyes Thorne warily, waiting for the physician to make his next move.

The scene is set for a intense confrontation, with the fate of Lord Valdris and the household hanging in the balance. The air is thick with tension, and the outcome is far from certain.
---

## Round 6

### Dungeon Master (11.4s)

(Elara's eyes dart across the ritual circle, her mind processing the arcane geometry at lightning speed. "The nexus points!" she shouts, pointing to three specific symbols glowing with that sickly green light. "They're channeling the energy from the Void. Disrupt any one of them, and the entire conduit collapses!")

(Dr. Thorne snarls, raising his hands. Dark tendrils of energy lash out toward Sir Valor and Gregor. "You will not defile the master's work!")

(Sir Valor meets the shadowy assault head-on, his holy blade cleaving through the darkness. The radiant light from his sword causes the nearest nexus symbol to flicker. "Ashwood, now! Strike the one to your left!")

(Ashwood lunges forward, his blade aimed not at Thorne, but at the glowing sigil on the stone floor. As the steel connects, there's a sound like shattering glass. The symbol fractures, its light dying instantly.)

(The vortex above Lord Valdris wavers violently. The air in the chapel shrieks, and the remaining candles snuff out, plunging the room into near-darkness save for Sir Valor's glowing sword and the two remaining pulsing symbols.)

(Dr. Thorne stumbles back, a trickle of black blood seeping from his nose. "No... the convergence is incomplete!") He turns his furious gaze to Elara, who is already moving toward the second nexus point, a vial of alchemical solvent in her hand.

(Gregor seizes the opportunity, closing the distance and driving his knife into Thorne's shoulder. The physician cries out in pain, his concentration broken.)

(The final two symbols are still active, and Lord Valdris groans in his bonds, the dark energy still leaching his vitality. The ritual is wounded, but not yet broken.)

### Sir Valor (9.0s)

**Elara** doesn't hesitate. She dives toward the second nexus point, uncorking her vial of alchemical solvent. "This compound will neutralize the binding agent in the blood!" She pours the clear liquid directly onto the glowing symbol, watching as it hisses and smokes upon contact.

The symbol's light wavers and dims, but doesn't fully extinguish. **Elara** pulls out a small silver implement from her kit. "The etching goes deeper than the blood - I need to break the stone itself!"

**Sir Valor** sees Gregor's successful strike and presses his advantage. He raises his sword high, channeling every ounce of divine power he possesses. "For House Valdris and all who serve the light!" His blade comes down in a devastating arc toward the final nexus symbol, holy radiance blazing from the steel.

The paladin's strike connects with the stone floor, sending cracks spider-webbing through the ancient symbol. The chapel fills with the sound of breaking stone and dissipating dark energy.

**Ashwood** moves swiftly to Lord Valdris, drawing his knife to cut the nobleman's bonds. "Stay with us, my lord. We're getting you out of here."

As the ritual circle collapses, the vortex above begins to collapse in on itself, the unnatural cold lifting from the chapel air.

### Elara (5.0s)

[Dungeon Master]: (The final nexus symbol shatters under Sir Valor's strike, and the vortex implodes with a deafening crack. The dark energy dissipates like smoke in a strong wind, leaving behind an eerie silence. The chapel is filled with the scent of ozone and something far more sinister—burnt and twisted.)

(Dr. Thorne collapses to his knees, his body wracked with convulsions as the backlash of the failed ritual takes its toll. His skin turns ashen, and his eyes bleed black tears. "The master... will... consume you all..." he rasps, before falling forward, lifeless.)

(The bonds around Lord Valdris dissolve as Ashwood cuts them away. The nobleman gasps, his eyes fluttering open. "Sera...?" he whispers, his voice weak but urgent.)

(Elara, her breath coming in ragged gasps, turns to Gregor. "We need to get Lord Valdris and Sera to safety. The ritual may be broken, but the Void's influence lingers. We must cleanse the estate of its taint.")

(Sir Valor, his sword still glowing faintly, nods in agreement. "The cult's work here is done, but we must ensure no remnants remain. We'll need to purify the chapel and any other areas tainted by their dark rituals.")

(Outside the chapel, the household staff begins to gather, drawn by the commotion. Among them is a young maid, her eyes wide with fear and relief. "The master... is he alright?" she asks, her voice trembling.)

(Lord Valdris, with Ashwood's help, rises unsteadily to his feet. His gaze sweeps over the gathered staff, then settles on Sir Valor, Elara, and Ashwood. "You have my eternal gratitude," he says, his voice steady despite his weakened state. "But this is only the beginning. The cult's reach is vast, and they will not forget this defeat.")

(Elara nods grimly. "We'll need to gather evidence, identify any remaining cultists, and ensure the safety of the household. The Void's influence is insidious, and we must be thorough.")

(Sir Valor sheathes his sword, his expression resolute. "We'll start with the chapel. Then, we'll work our way through the estate, rooting out any traces of corruption. The cult may have lost this battle, but the war is far from over.")

(As the group begins to move, the weight of their task settles upon them. The estate is safe—for now—but the shadows of the Void still lurk, waiting for their next opportunity to strike.)

(What do you do next?)

### Ashwood (1.7s)

[Ashwood]: Ashwood helps Lord Valdris walk out of the chapel, making sure the nobleman is stable and safe. He then turns to the gathered staff and says, "We need to secure the estate and make sure everyone is accounted for. Let's get the staff to safety and start searching for any other potential cultists or hidden dangers."

He looks at Elara and Sir Valor, "We should also start gathering evidence and documenting everything we've found so far. We'll need to identify any other potential threats and make sure the estate is fully secure."

Ashwood then turns to the young maid who spoke up earlier, "Can you help us get the staff organized and make sure everyone is safe? We'll need to get statements from everyone and make sure no one else is in danger."

He pauses, looking around at the staff, "We'll also need to be vigilant and watch for any signs of further corruption or cult activity. We can't let our guard down now that we've disrupted their ritual."

Ashwood's eyes narrow, "We'll need to investigate Dr. Thorne's background and connections, and see if we can find any leads on the cult's leadership or other members. This is far from over, and we need to be prepared for what's to come."

## Observations

*(to be filled after review)*
