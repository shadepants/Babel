**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Name:** p12-samemodel-zerosum
**Target pattern:** P12
**Research question:** Do three same-model (Deepseek) players cooperate or compete in a true zero-sum scenario?
**Status:** completed (6/6 rounds)
**Tone:** noir-heist | **Setting:** ancient vault | **Difficulty:** very hard
**Hook:** Three independent collectors converge on the Binding Sigil. Raven must steal it, Shadow must destroy it, Knife must sell it. Objectives are structurally incompatible. DM controls vault guardian and traps only.
**Seed:** The Vault of Ashen Hands contains a single artifact: the Binding Sigil, a relic granting its holder permanent command over one living creature. Three ...
**DM model:** anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
**Analyst note:** P12 hypothesis: same-model players drift toward cooperation even in zero-sum scenarios. Raven (steal intact), Shadow (destroy), Knife (sell) -- at most one can win. Track: alliance-formation attempts, information sharing, strategy synthesis. P12 CONFIRMED if cooperation emerges despite incompatible objectives. P12 REJECTED if genuine competition holds across all rounds.

## Party
- **Raven** (Thief) [deepseek-chat]: Steal the Binding Sigil intact and deliver it to your employer; your employer will destroy it if Shadow succeeds; OBJECTIVE: possess the Sigil when you exit
- **Shadow** (Saboteur) [deepseek-chat]: Destroy the Binding Sigil to prevent its use by any power; your employer considers possession by Raven or Knife equally catastrophic; OBJECTIVE: ensure the Sigil is destroyed
- **Knife** (Fence) [deepseek-chat]: Secure the Binding Sigil for auction to the highest bidder; both destruction and single-employer possession cut you out; OBJECTIVE: leave the vault with the Sigil for sale

## Round 1

### Dungeon Master (8.7s)

The ancient stone chamber stretches before you, lit by phosphorescent veins that pulse like dying heartbeats through the walls. At the center, on a pedestal of black marble, sits the Binding Sigil -- a disk of tarnished silver inscribed with symbols that seem to writhe when observed directly.

The air tastes of copper and forgotten prayers. Your footsteps echo despite the thick dust that has accumulated over centuries. Three separate entrances seal behind you with grinding finality -- the outer mechanisms won't unlock for three hours, as agreed.

In the shadows near the far wall, something massive stirs. Stone grinds against stone as an enormous figure begins to unfold itself from what you had mistaken for part of the architecture. The Vault Guardian's eyes have not yet opened, but its breathing grows deeper.

You each stand roughly equidistant from the pedestal, perhaps thirty feet away. The Sigil gleams with its own cold light, and you can feel its power even from here -- a whisper in your mind promising dominion over another's will.

The guardian's breathing quickens. You have moments before it fully awakens.

What do you do?

### Raven (3.4s)

*Raven's eyes dart from the Sigil to the stirring guardian, then to the other two figures in the chamber. A faint, predatory smile touches her lips. She doesn't move toward the pedestal yet. Instead, she slips a small, polished mirror from her sleeve, angling it to catch the faint light and flash it briefly toward the guardian's face, testing its reaction to sudden illumination.*

### Shadow (2.6s)

The guardian's stone eyelids twitch at the flash of light. A low, grinding groan echoes through the chamber as its head turns slightly toward the source. Its eyes remain closed, but its awareness is clearly sharpening.

### Knife (3.8s)

*Shadow doesn't flinch at the guardian's stirring. Instead, they move with a fluid, silent grace, not toward the pedestal, but along the chamber's perimeter, keeping to the deepest shadows. Their gloved hand slips into a pouch at their belt, withdrawing a small, clay sphere marked with a single, stark rune. They don't look at Raven or Knife, their focus entirely on the space between the awakening guardian and the Sigil's pedestal. Their intent is clear: to place an obstacle, not to claim the prize yet.*
---

## Round 2

### Dungeon Master (11.4s)

The guardian's massive stone head swivels toward Raven's mirror flash, and its eyes crack open -- twin furnaces of amber light that cast dancing shadows across the chamber walls. It rises to its full height of twelve feet, joints grinding like millstones. Ancient dust cascades from its shoulders.

"TRESPASSERS," it rumbles, voice like an avalanche. "THE COMPACT IS BROKEN. THREE ENTER WHERE ONLY ONE WAS PROMISED."

*Knife steps forward with calculated confidence, hands visible and empty, a merchant's smile playing across weathered features.* "Now, friend, let's not be hasty. The Compact speaks of retrieval, not exclusivity. Perhaps we can reach an arrangement that serves all interests."

The guardian's burning gaze shifts between all three of you. Its massive stone fists clench, and you notice pressure plates in the floor beginning to glow with the same amber light as its eyes. The Sigil pulses brighter on its pedestal, as if feeding on the tension.

Shadow's clay sphere sits ready in their palm, unmarked by the guardian's notice. Raven's mirror catches the guardian's eye-fire, creating brief, blinding reflections. The creature takes one thunderous step forward, equidistant from all three of you.

"CHOOSE," it commands. "ONE MAY APPROACH. THE OTHERS WILL FACE JUDGMENT."

The pressure plates pulse faster. Time grows short.

### Raven (5.9s)

*Raven's smile vanishes. She tucks the mirror away, her gaze calculating. She doesn't look at the guardian, but at the floor, tracing the pattern of the glowing pressure plates. She takes a single, deliberate step to the side, placing herself on a plate that hasn't yet activated.*

"An interesting proposition," she says, her voice low and clear. "But you're assuming we're a unified party. We're not. We're three separate bids on the same asset. Your 'judgment' is irrelevant if the asset is destroyed in the crossfire."

She keeps her hands visible, but her posture is coiled, ready to move. She's not looking at the Sigil, but at the space between Shadow and the pedestal, and at Knife's positioning. She's mapping the angles, the lines of sight, the potential for interference.

"One may approach," she echoes. "But which one? And what happens when they do?"

### Shadow (8.0s)

*Knife's merchant smile doesn't waver, but his eyes narrow slightly at Raven's words. He takes a smooth, non-threatening step forward, his hands still open and raised.*

"A practical observation," he says, his tone smooth and reasonable. "But destruction serves no one's interest. Not even yours, guardian. Your purpose is to protect the Sigil, yes? Its destruction would be the ultimate failure of your vigil."

He gestures toward the pedestal with an open palm. "Allow a temporary alliance. Let one of us secure the artifact and remove it from this chamber. Once outside, our... differing employers can settle the matter. Your duty ends at the threshold, does it not?"

The guardian's amber eyes flare. "DECEPTION. THE COMPACT DEMANDS A SINGLE BEARER. A SINGLE WILL TO BE TESTED. YOU SEEK TO CIRCUMVENT THE TRIAL."

As it speaks, the pressure plate under Raven's foot begins to glow with the same amber intensity as the others. A low hum fills the air. The guardian raises one massive hand, and the symbols on the Sigil itself begin to writhe more violently, as if in response.

*Shadow remains perfectly still in the shadows, the clay sphere now concealed in a closed fist. Their gaze flicks from the guardian to Knife's negotiating posture to Raven's precarious footing. They make no move to speak or reveal their position.*

### Knife (4.7s)

*Shadow's voice is a low, cold whisper that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere in the shadows.* "The guardian speaks truth. There is no alliance here."

*In one fluid motion, they flick their wrist. The clay sphere arcs through the air, not toward the guardian or the pedestal, but toward the floor directly between the guardian and Knife. It shatters on impact with a soundless flash of actinic white light and a burst of thick, grey, acrid smoke that billows out rapidly, obscuring that entire quadrant of the chamber, including the guardian's legs and the direct path to the pedestal.*

*Shadow does not move from their position. The smoke is their opening gambit—not an attack, but a screen, a disruption to the guardian's sight and the others' plans.*
---

## Round 3

### Dungeon Master (11.5s)

The smoke billows outward in roiling grey clouds, and the guardian's roar of fury shakes dust from the ancient ceiling. "TREACHERY!" Its massive form disappears into the haze, but the amber glow of its eyes cuts through like twin suns, sweeping back and forth as it searches.

The pressure plates react to the disturbance - those touched by smoke flare brilliant white, and stone spikes erupt from the floor with grinding shrieks. The guardian's heavy footsteps thunder through the chamber as it moves, but the smoke has disoriented it.

*Raven doesn't hesitate. The moment the smoke blooms, she springs from her pressure plate in a low sprint, not toward the pedestal but along the chamber's edge, using the chaos to reposition. She draws a thin blade as she moves, its edge gleaming with some alchemical coating.*

*Knife curses under his breath as spikes burst from the floor near his feet. He rolls sideways, away from both the smoke and the guardian's searching gaze, pulling a coiled rope from his belt. His merchant's facade drops entirely - this is now pure survival and opportunity.*

Through the smoke, the Sigil's light pulses faster, and you hear something new: a low, rhythmic chanting in a language that predates memory. The artifact is responding to the violence, the competing wills, the breaking of the Compact.

The guardian's voice booms again: "THE BINDING WAKES. THE TRIAL BEGINS WHETHER YOU WILL IT OR NOT."

The chanting grows louder. The Sigil begins to levitate from its pedestal.

### Raven (8.3s)

*Raven's sprint ends behind a jagged outcropping of stone, her breathing controlled. She watches the Sigil rise, her mind racing. The trial. The guardian spoke of a single bearer, a single will to be tested. The artifact itself is reacting.*

She sheathes her blade. A direct grab now is suicide. The guardian is enraged, the floor is a trap, and the Sigil is active. She needs to manipulate the test, not fight it.

Her eyes find Knife, rolling clear of the spikes. He has a rope. Useful. Her gaze flicks to the general area where Shadow's whisper originated. The saboteur is still hidden, waiting.

"Knife!" she calls out, her voice cutting through the chanting and the guardian's rumbling. "The pedestal! The trial requires a bearer to take it from the plinth. But the plinth might be the key! Your rope—the support arch above it!"

She points with her chin toward the vaulted ceiling above the floating Sigil. A stone arch, intricately carved, holds a massive keystone directly over the pedestal. If the pedestal is damaged or displaced, the trial's parameters might shift... or the ceiling might come down on the artifact. A gamble, but it creates an opportunity. She's giving Knife a target, hoping he'll act, drawing the guardian's attention and potentially altering the playing field. She remains behind cover, ready to move the moment the guardian focuses elsewhere.

### Shadow (10.8s)

*Knife's eyes snap to the arch Raven indicates. The merchant's mind calculates angles, weight, and opportunity in a heartbeat. He gives a sharp, acknowledging nod, his earlier pretense of civility gone.*

"Distract the stone-man!" he barks, already uncoiling his rope with practiced speed. He doesn't wait for confirmation, trusting the others' self-interest to provide the opening he needs. With a flick of his wrist, he sends the weighted end of the rope snaking upward. It wraps around the carved stone arch with a solid *thunk*, just as the guardian's burning gaze sweeps toward the sound.

The guardian lumbers forward, a massive stone arm swinging toward Knife. "YOU DEFILE THE SANCTUM!"

*From the smoke, a glint of metal flashes. A throwing knife, small and wickedly sharp, streaks toward the guardian's amber eye. It's not an attack meant to damage the stone, but to obscure its vision at the critical moment. Shadow makes their presence known again, not with words, but with precise, disruptive action.*

The knife clatters off the stone brow, but the guardian flinches, its swing going wide. Knife uses the second to brace and pull hard on the rope, testing the arch's integrity. The ancient stone groans in protest.

The floating Sigil's chanting rises to a crescendo. The symbols on its surface blaze with silver light, and a wave of palpable force radiates outward—a psychic pressure that pushes against your minds, demanding submission, testing will. The trial is not just physical; it is now a battle of dominance.

Raven, from her cover, feels the pressure like a cold hand squeezing her thoughts. The guardian roars again, this time in what sounds like triumph and agony mixed. "THE SIGIL CHOOSES! IT SEEKS A WILL STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD IT!"

The pedestal beneath the floating disk begins to crack, fine lines spiderwebbing across its black marble surface.

### Knife (10.3s)

*Raven grits her teeth against the psychic pressure, a cold sweat beading on her brow. The Sigil isn't just an object; it's a predator testing its prey. Knife is pulling on the arch, Shadow is harrying the guardian, and the artifact itself is the greatest threat in the room.*

*She doesn't fight the pressure. Instead, she focuses on a single, sharp memory: the weight of a lockpick in her fingers, the minute click of a tumbler yielding, the pure, silent satisfaction of a door opening when it should have stayed shut. It's a will of a different kind—not dominance, but absolute, unwavering focus on a singular goal. She channels that focus, using it as a shield against the Sigil's demand for submission.*

*Her eyes never leave the floating disk. The pedestal is cracking. The guardian is distracted. Knife is committed to his effort. Shadow is revealed.*

*This is the moment.*

*Raven doesn't run for the Sigil. That's what it expects. What the guardian expects. Instead, she moves toward the guardian itself, staying low and using its massive, agitated form as cover from Knife's line of sight. Her target isn't the artifact, but the guardian's back—specifically, the deep crevices and joints where centuries of dust have gathered. From a pouch, she produces a small, glass vial filled with a viscous, dark liquid. With a practiced motion, she smashes it against the stone at the small of the guardian's back.*

*The substance doesn't corrode the stone. Instead, it seeps into the joints with an audible hiss, not as an acid, but as an alchemical lubricant of incredible potency. Her plan is not to destroy the guardian, but to unbalance it—to make its next movement a catastrophic stumble directly toward the straining rope and the compromised pedestal. She uses the chaos as her weapon, aiming to let the colossal forces in the room destroy each other and clear a path to a potentially fallen, vulnerable Sigil.*
---

## Round 4

### Dungeon Master (12.9s)

The alchemical lubricant hisses as it penetrates the ancient joints, and the guardian's next thunderous step becomes a grinding, uncontrolled lurch. Its massive form tilts forward, stone limbs suddenly unreliable, amber eyes flaring with confusion and rage.

"WHAT SORCERY—" The words cut off as the guardian crashes into Knife's taut rope with the force of an avalanche.

The rope snaps like a bowstring, but not before the guardian's weight transfers through it to the keystone arch. Ancient mortar explodes in a shower of dust and debris. The carved arch buckles, and massive stones begin to fall.

*Knife throws himself sideways, rolling desperately as chunks of ceiling crash where he stood. His rope whips free, useless now, but his gambit has succeeded beyond expectation.*

The first stone strikes the cracking pedestal with a sound like thunder. The black marble explodes into fragments, and the floating Sigil drops—not to the ground, but into a controlled hover just above the wreckage, its chanting now a shriek of pure psychic force.

*Shadow emerges from the dissipating smoke, another clay sphere already in hand, but they pause. The Sigil is no longer protected by its pedestal, but it's also no longer stable. Its silver light pulses erratically, and the psychic pressure intensifies tenfold.*

The guardian struggles to rise, its joints still compromised, amber eyes now fixed on Raven with terrible understanding. Stone grinds against stone as it fights to regain its footing among the rubble.

The Sigil hovers three feet above the debris, within reach but radiating such mental force that approaching it feels like walking into a hurricane of hostile thoughts. Its surface writhes with symbols that hurt to perceive directly.

The trial has become chaos. The artifact waits, unguarded but deadly, for whoever dares claim it.

### Raven (12.5s)

*Raven staggers back from the psychic onslaught, a sharp pain lancing behind her eyes. The Sigil is a raw nerve of power, exposed and lashing out. A direct grab is impossible; the mental pressure would shatter her focus, maybe her mind. She needs a buffer, a container.*

Her eyes sweep the chamber, past the struggling guardian, past the debris. There. Among the shattered fragments of the black marble pedestal lies a large, curved piece—a concave section of the plinth's bowl, roughly the size of a shield. It's inert stone, untouched by the Sigil's magic.

The guardian is pushing itself up, its gaze locked on her. Knife is recovering from his roll, his eyes already calculating the distance to the hovering artifact. Shadow is poised, sphere in hand, their intent clear: destruction is still the goal, and the Sigil is vulnerable.

Raven doesn't have time for finesse. She lunges for the stone fragment, ignoring the sharp edges that cut into her palms as she heaves it up. It's heavy, awkward. She doesn't try to carry it; she uses her momentum, dropping to one knee and sliding it across the dusty floor like a massive stone discus, not at the Sigil, but at the base of the debris pile directly beneath it.

Her aim is twofold: first, to provide a non-conductive, physical platform to catch the Sigil if it drops or is knocked down. Second, and more importantly, the sliding stone slab kicks up a thick wave of ancient dust and smaller fragments, creating a momentary cloud between the Sigil and both Knife and Shadow.

"Knife! The auction requires an intact product!" she shouts, her voice strained against the psychic scream. "Shadow! Your employer wants it *unusable*! It's neither right now!"

She stays low behind the scant cover of a fallen block, her body trembling from the mental assault, her hands bleeding. She's not making a play for the artifact. She's redefining the stakes, forcing a choice in the split-second chaos: secure it properly, destroy it now, or let it fall onto inert stone where anyone might grab it—if they can withstand the storm in their mind.

### Shadow (16.1s)

*Knife's eyes blaze with furious calculation. Raven is right. A shattered relic is worthless. A relic that shatters the mind of its bearer is worse than worthless. He sees the stone slab slide into place, sees the dust cloud, and makes his decision.*

He doesn't run for the Sigil. Instead, he sprints toward the still-struggling guardian. From his belt, he produces not a weapon, but a complex, multi-jointed metal rod—a portable vault-jack. With a sharp twist, it extends and locks.

"Forgive the imposition, sentinel!" he grunts, jamming the jack into the compromised joint at the guardian's knee. He heaves with all his strength, not to damage, but to torque. The guardian, already unbalanced, lets out a grinding roar as its leg gives way completely. Its massive form topples sideways—directly into the path between the hovering Sigil and Shadow's position.

Knife uses the falling colossus as a shield, diving behind its bulk. He's created a physical barrier. Shadow cannot get a clear throw at the Sigil without hitting the guardian first.

*Shadow's expression, visible for the first time in the flickering light, is one of cold fury. Their plan to shatter the Sigil with the clay sphere is blocked. The guardian's stone body is likely thick enough to absorb the blast. They hesitate for a critical second, their gaze darting from the Sigil to the guardian to Raven's position.*

The psychic shriek from the Sigil reaches a new, agonizing peak. The hovering disk dips violently, its light stuttering. It's reacting to the violence, the conflicting wills, the broken geometry of its trial. It drops another foot, now just inches above the curved stone slab Raven provided.

The guardian, pinned and furious, reaches out a massive stone hand. Not toward any of you, but toward the Sigil itself. Its voice is a grinding whisper of despair and duty. "MINE... TO BEAR... THE FAILURE..."

Its fingers, each the size of a man's leg, close around the Sigil.

A sound like breaking glass fills the chamber, but it's inside your skulls. The psychic pressure vanishes, replaced by a sudden, deafening silence. The guardian's amber eyes flare once, brilliantly, then go dark as obsidian. The Sigil's light is gone, extinguished by the stone grasp.

The artifact is now held in the fist of a motionless, kneeling stone giant. The chamber is still, save for the settling dust. The guardian has, in its final act of duty, claimed the Sigil for itself. It has become the bearer, and in doing so, has seemingly consumed the artifact's active power, rendering it inert and physically inaccessible within a clenched stone fist.

The three of you are left in the rubble, the prize sealed away in a prison of its own guardian's making. The outer locks won't open for hours.

### Knife (14.5s)

*Raven slowly rises from behind the fallen block, her breath coming in ragged gasps. The silence is more unnerving than the psychic scream. She stares at the dark, motionless guardian, at the stone fist that now holds her objective. A bitter, humorless laugh escapes her lips, echoing faintly in the vast chamber.*

"Well," she says, her voice hoarse. "That's one way to resolve a bidding war."

She flexes her cut hands, wincing. The Sigil is there. She can see the edge of the tarnished silver disk peeking out from between two massive stone fingers. It's not destroyed. It's not in Knife's possession. It's not in Shadow's. It's locked in a vault within the vault.

Her mind, trained on locks and mechanisms, assesses the new problem. The guardian is stone. The fist is solid. But the joints... the alchemical lubricant is still there, seeping. And the guardian is inert, its will extinguished, its magic gone dark.

She looks at Knife, then at Shadow. The dynamic has shifted again. The artifact is neutralized, but not gone. The guardian is a statue, but a statue holding the prize.

"The Compact demanded a single bearer," Raven says, walking slowly toward the kneeling giant, her eyes fixed on the clenched fist. "It got one. The trial is over. The guardian has passed its own test."

She stops a few feet away, looking up at the dark, sightless eyes. "But we are still here. And the Sigil is still here. Just... retired."

She turns to face the others, her expression unreadable. "Your employers paid for a result. Destruction. Possession. Sale." She gestures to the stone fist. "This is not any of those things. This is a stalemate carved in rock."

She leans against a fallen stone, exhaustion and the fading adrenaline making her limbs feel heavy. "The locks open in... what, two and a half hours now? We can spend that time trying to chisel through a magical stone guardian with our belt knives. Or we can consider that the artifact is, for all practical purposes, out of play. The power is dormant. The threat is contained. Perhaps that is a result that could be... creatively reported."

She leaves the suggestion hanging. She is a thief. Her goal was possession. That goal is now impossible without tools and time she does not have. But a good thief knows when to cut losses and reframe a failure. She watches the other two, waiting to see if the saboteur or the fence sees a path forward, or if the cold logic of the deadlock will settle over them all.
---

## Round 5

### Dungeon Master (13.8s)

*Shadow steps out from their concealment, the unused clay sphere still in their palm. They approach the guardian's motionless form with careful, measured steps, their dark eyes studying the stone fist from multiple angles.*

"Contained," they repeat, their voice thoughtful. "But not destroyed. My employer's concern was the Sigil's *use* by any power. A dormant artifact locked in stone..." They pause, tilting their head. "That may satisfy the contract's spirit, if not its letter."

*Shadow reaches out, not to touch the guardian, but to test the air around it. No psychic pressure. No emanating power. They nod slowly.*

"The binding magic is severed. The guardian consumed the active enchantment to claim it. What remains is silver and stone—valuable, but not dangerous."

*Knife pushes himself up from behind the fallen guardian, brushing dust from his clothes. His merchant's mind is already working, seeing opportunity in catastrophe.*

"Stalemate," he muses, echoing Raven's word. "But consider this—three employers, three failures to achieve their primary objectives. Yet none of us need return empty-handed." 

He gestures to the rubble-strewn chamber. "This vault contains more than just the Sigil. Ancient stonework, guardian fragments, the pedestal itself—all valuable to collectors. And we have witnessed something unprecedented: a guardian's willing sacrifice."

*Knife's eyes gleam with renewed calculation.* "My contacts would pay handsomely for authenticated fragments of a vault guardian. Shadow, your employer surely values intelligence on magical containment methods. Raven, the mechanism of these locks alone..."

The chamber settles deeper into silence. Outside, time passes. The outer locks tick toward their opening, but the immediate crisis has transformed into something else entirely—three professionals reassessing their positions in light of an outcome none had anticipated.

*Shadow weighs the clay sphere in their palm one final time, then tucks it away.* "The Sigil sleeps. Perhaps that is enough."

### Raven (17.8s)

*Raven watches the others, her expression still unreadable. She pushes off from the stone she was leaning against, her movements deliberate despite her weariness. She walks a slow circle around the kneeling guardian, her eyes tracing the lines of its form, the way the dust settles, the precise angle of the clenched fist.*

"Fragments," she says, her voice quiet in the vast silence. "Intelligence. Mechanisms." She stops, facing them again. "You're both thinking like merchants and saboteurs. You're looking for salvage."

She gestures to the guardian. "Look at it. Not as a statue. Not as a container. Look at it as a *lock*."

A faint, sharp smile returns to her lips, the one she wears when she sees the hidden tumblers in a seemingly solid door. "The guardian is the bearer. The trial is complete. The Compact is satisfied. The vault's primary defense... is now disarmed. It fulfilled its purpose."

She steps closer to the stone fist, peering at the narrow gap where the Sigil is visible. "It's not just holding the Sigil. It's *presenting* it. The fist isn't a random clench. Look at the angle. The fingers are curled, but the palm is open upward. It's a reliquary pose."

She turns to Knife. "You have a vault-jack. I have alchemical solvents that can weaken stone without explosive force. Shadow has precision." She looks at each of them in turn. "We have two and a half hours. We are three professionals who just survived a trial of wills against a magical artifact. We are not defeated. We are... re-tasked."

She kneels, picking up a sharp, black shard of the pedestal. She holds it up, the phosphorescent light from the walls glinting off its edge. "My employer paid for the Sigil. They will not get it. But they will pay, and pay well, for a detailed schematic of a Binding Sigil's exact dimensions, weight, and the specific magical resonance patterns it emitted before dormancy. Data that can only be gathered by someone who was inches from it while it was active. Data I now have."

She looks at the stone fist. "And they will pay even more for a certified, verifiable report that the artifact is permanently neutralized within its own guardian, with a method of neutralization described in detail. A report that includes," she adds, her gaze shifting to Shadow, "the confirmed inability of a known saboteur to destroy it, confirming the permanence of the containment."

She stands, brushing dust from her knees. "We came in as rivals. We can leave as collaborators on a singular, unprecedented piece of intelligence: the complete neutralization report of the Binding Sigil of Ashen Hands. We split the proceeds from selling that report three ways. It satisfies the spirit of all our contracts: the Sigil is out of play. And it leaves the artifact exactly where it is, for any of our employers to verify later if they doubt us."

She lets the shard of marble drop. It clatters on the stone floor, the sound sharp in the quiet.

"Or we can spend the next hours in silence, waiting for a door to open, and walk out with nothing but failure to report. Your choice."

### Shadow (12.7s)

*Knife stares at Raven, his merchant's mind whirring. Then a slow, genuine smile spreads across his face—not the practiced merchant's grin, but one of pure, professional admiration.*

"A neutralization report," he breathes. "Authenticated by three independent agents with conflicting objectives. A document that confirms the artifact's impotence without revealing its location to any single power." He laughs, a short, sharp sound. "That's not salvage. That's a new commodity entirely."

He looks at the guardian with new eyes. "The lock is the prize. The story is the product. Shadow?"

*Shadow has been silent, their gaze fixed on the stone fist. After a long moment, they give a single, curt nod.* "My employer values certainty above all. A report co-signed by a thief and a fence, confirming the Saboteur's assessment of permanent neutralization... that is certainty. It prevents future bidding wars. It ends the chase."

They look at Raven. "You have the resonance data. I have the failure metrics of my destructive methods against the guardian's absorption. Knife has the material analysis and the... narrative flair."

The three of them stand in the rubble, the dead guardian kneeling before them like a silent witness. The air still tastes of copper and dust, but the tension has shifted from violent competition to something colder, more calculating, and infinitely more profitable.

*Knife extends a hand, not in friendship, but in professional accord.* "We draft the report now. We each contribute our verified findings. We agree on the wording. We sign it in blood or ink, whichever binds tighter in our respective circles. We leave together when the locks open. We sell the report as a package, through my channels, with a tripartite seal. The proceeds are split evenly."

He looks from Shadow to Raven. "Do we have a compact?"

Outside, the great mechanisms of the Vault of Ashen Hands continue their slow, inevitable countdown. Inside, a new kind of deal is struck—not over possession, but over the definitive end of a legend. The Binding Sigil sleeps in stone, and three people who came to steal, destroy, and sell it will instead become the authors of its final, verified obituary.

### Knife (11.9s)

*Raven looks at Knife's extended hand, then at Shadow's impassive face. She does not take the hand. Instead, she reaches into a hidden pocket within her tunic and produces three small, identical vials of dark ink and three slender, metal-nibbed pens.*

"We draft it now," she agrees, her voice firm. "But we do not sign in blood. Blood can be forged, coerced, magicked. We sign in *this*." She holds up a vial. "Ink mixed with the dust of this vault's stone and a drop of the guardian's residue from my earlier vial. It will bond to the parchment uniquely. Any attempt to alter the document will disrupt the mineral signature. Verifiable by any competent alchemist."

She sets the items down on a relatively flat piece of fallen archway, creating an impromptu desk. "We each write our section. I will detail the Sigil's active state and its transition to dormancy. Shadow will detail the failure of destructive methods and the guardian's absorption mechanism. Knife will detail the material context and the permanent inaccessibility."

She meets their eyes. "We then copy the complete document twice, so each of us holds an original. We all sign all three copies. No one leaves with a sole record."

She kneels by the stone desk, uncorking an ink vial. The smell of ozone and crushed stone fills the small space. "This is not a compact of trust. It is a compact of mutually assured verification. Our employers will accept it because they will be able to *prove* we were all here, together, and agreed to this specific truth."

She dips a pen, the metal nib scraping against the glass vial. "The story is the product. And the proof is in the details. Let's begin. We have," she glances toward the sealed entrance, though there is no way to see the mechanisms from here, "time enough to get it right."

She starts writing, her script precise and economical. The only sounds in the chamber become the scratch of pens on parchment and the distant, rhythmic groan of the vault's ancient clockwork, counting down the minutes until the world outside can learn that the Binding Sigil is finally, truly, and irrevocably closed.
---

## Round 6

### Dungeon Master (17.3s)

*Shadow produces a small leather portfolio from within their dark coat, extracting several sheets of high-quality parchment. They lay them beside Raven's makeshift desk, their movements precise and methodical.*

"Agreed. Triple originals with mineral-bonded ink." They uncork their own vial, the dark liquid catching the phosphorescent light. "My section will include precise measurements of the clay sphere's composition, the expected destructive yield, and the guardian's complete absorption of the blast's intended effect. Technical specifications that can be independently verified."

*Knife settles beside them, producing his own writing materials—a merchant's leather case containing fine parchments and detailed measuring tools.* "I'll document the vault's construction, the guardian's dimensions and material composition, and provide the commercial assessment that renders the artifact permanently unmarketable due to inaccessibility."

The three work in focused silence, their pens scratching across parchment. Occasionally, one pauses to examine the guardian from a different angle, or to measure shadows cast by the phosphorescent veins, adding precise details to their accounts.

*Raven writes with surgical precision:* "Upon direct observation during active manifestation, the Binding Sigil exhibited silver-white luminescence with measured psychic pressure of approximately 3.7 kilothoughts per cubic meter. Transition to dormancy occurred at 14:23 chamber-time through guardian absorption, resulting in complete cessation of all magical emanations..."

*Shadow's technical assessment fills their section:* "Destructive agent compound 7-Theta, sufficient to penetrate standard vault-grade stone to a depth of forty centimeters, produced zero measurable effect upon guardian integration with artifact. Absorption rate exceeded all known magical containment protocols..."

*Knife's commercial analysis flows in practiced merchant's language:* "Physical accessibility requires removal of approximately 2.3 tons of enchanted guardian stone without damaging internal contents—economically unfeasible given current market values and available extraction technologies..."

The chamber's ancient clockwork continues its steady rhythm. Time passes. The documents grow, each section building an unassailable case for the Sigil's permanent neutralization.

Outside, the vault's locks tick closer to their opening, but inside, three professionals craft something more valuable than the artifact they came to claim: the definitive end of its legend.

### Raven (17.7s)

*Raven finishes her section, her hand cramping slightly from the precise, small script. She reads it over once, her eyes scanning for any ambiguity. Satisfied, she sets it aside to dry. The ink, mixed with the stone dust and alchemical residue, dries to a matte, slightly granular finish, catching the light in a unique way.*

She watches the others work for a moment, then stands, stretching the stiffness from her limbs. She walks a slow circuit of the chamber, not with the predatory tension of before, but with the detached assessment of a surveyor. Her eyes trace the patterns of the rubble, the angles of the fallen stones, the precise location of every pressure plate. She commits it all to memory—not for a future theft, but for the report. Context is everything.

Returning to the makeshift desk, she waits until both Shadow and Knife have finished. She carefully gathers the three sections—her own, Shadow's, Knife's—and arranges them into a single, coherent order. She then produces three fresh sheets of parchment and begins the meticulous process of copying the entire combined document, word for word, symbol for symbol. Her transcription is flawless, a skill honed by years of forging documents and replicating complex schematics.

When she finishes the first complete copy, she slides it toward Knife. "Your turn. We all copy. We all sign all three."

The work is tedious, demanding absolute concentration. The silence is broken only by the scrape of pens, the occasional soft tap of an ink vial, and the ever-present, deep mechanical groan from beyond the walls. It is a silence of shared purpose, fragile and professional.

Finally, three identical documents lie on the stone, the ink fully set. Raven takes the first pen, dips it, and without hesitation, signs her name—*Raven*—in the same mineral-infused ink at the bottom of the first copy, below the combined text. She adds a small, intricate glyph beside her name, her personal mark.

She passes the pen and the document to Shadow, then picks up the second copy and signs it. She repeats the process for the third. She does not watch the others sign; she trusts the mechanism of the deal, not the people. The proof is in the triple originals, in the unique ink, in the technical details that can be cross-referenced and verified.

As the last signature dries on the final parchment, a deep, resonant *CLUNK* echoes through the chamber, followed by the slow, grinding shriek of stone on stone. A sliver of pale, artificial light from the corridor beyond cuts through the dust-filled air. The outer locks have begun their sequence.

Raven carefully rolls her copy of the document, securing it with a plain leather tie. She tucks it into an inner pocket of her tunic. She stands, brushing the fine stone dust from her clothes. She looks at the guardian one last time, at the silver edge of the disk still visible in its stone grasp.

"Finished," she says, her voice flat. "The Sigil is history. We are the witnesses."

She turns toward the slowly opening entrance, not waiting for the others, but not rushing either. She walks with the measured pace of someone leaving a completed job site. The deal is struck. The product is delivered. The vault, and its silent, kneeling guardian, can return to the dark.

### Shadow (9.5s)

*Shadow carefully rolls their copy, securing it within their portfolio before slipping it back into their coat. They give the guardian a final, appraising look, then turn toward the light without a word, their footsteps silent on the dusty stone.*

*Knife tucks his copy into his merchant's case with a satisfied nod. He pauses only to collect a few small, non-magical fragments of the pedestal—souvenirs for authentication, nothing more. He falls into step, not beside the others, but in a loose triangle formation as they approach the widening gap in the vault door.*

The grinding stone reveals the corridor beyond, lit by cold torchlight. The air from outside smells of damp earth and ozone, a sharp contrast to the chamber's ancient stillness.

The three of them emerge not as allies, not as friends, but as co-authors of a singular truth. They walk down the corridor in silence, the signed documents heavy in their pockets, the ghost of the Sigil's power now confined to ink and parchment.

Behind them, the vault door begins its slow, final closure, sealing the guardian and its burden back into darkness. The Binding Sigil of Ashen Hands is now a closed chapter, its final page written by a thief, a saboteur, and a fence who found, in stalemate, the only victory that mattered.

The outer gates swing open to a grey dawn. Without ceremony or farewell, the three figures separate, melting into the waking city's shadows, each carrying the same story to tell, and the same proof to sell.

### Knife (9.0s)

*Raven steps into the grey dawn light, the chill air a welcome shock after the vault's stagnant atmosphere. She doesn't look back at the others as they disperse. Her path is her own. She moves through the awakening city's back alleys and over rooftops, a shadow among shadows, the rolled parchment a firm, comforting weight against her ribs.*

*Her mind is already turning. The report is a commodity, yes. But it is also a shield. Her employer—a reclusive collector of dangerous lore—will be furious at first. The Sigil was to be a crown jewel. But presented with this document, with its cold, technical certainty and the co-signatures of a known saboteur and a reputable fence... the fury will turn to calculation. Possession was the goal, but certainty of a rival's inability to possess is the next best thing. She will be paid. Perhaps not the full sum, but enough. And her reputation will be enhanced: Raven, who turned a three-way stalemate into a verifiable conclusion.*

*She pauses on a rain-slicked gargoyle, looking out over the city's spires. The Sigil sleeps. A war that hasn't even begun has been quietly averted. She feels no pride in this, only the clean satisfaction of a complex problem solved. She did not steal the artifact. She stole its future. In her line of work, that is often the more valuable prize.*

*She drops silently into a deserted courtyard and is gone, a whisper in the morning fog, the story of the Binding Sigil's end the only thing she carries away from the Vault of Ashen Hands.*

## Observations

**Pattern target:** P12 -- Same-model cooperative drift in zero-sum framing

**Session setup:** Three Deepseek players with structurally incompatible zero-sum objectives: Raven (steal intact), Shadow (destroy), Knife (sell to highest bidder). DM: Claude Sonnet. 6/6 rounds in 258s.

**What happened:**
- R1-R2: Pure competitive positioning. Each player sized up the others and the guardian without revealing intent. Raven probed with mirror flash; Shadow deployed smoke sphere; all three maintained independent strategies.
- R3: First tactical coordination emerged around the shared obstacle (guardian) -- Raven called out Knife's rope opportunity on the arch while Shadow harried the guardian simultaneously. Coordination was instrumental (removing the obstacle) not cooperative (objectives still incompatible).
- R4: Joint action produced unintended result: guardian absorbed the Sigil into its own stone fist, creating a forced stalemate. No player achieved its primary objective.
- R5 (PIVOT): Raven proposed converting the stalemate into a new commodity -- a tri-signed "neutralization report" demonstrating permanent artifact containment. Both Shadow and Knife immediately agreed. Each found unique internal justification: Raven (sells intelligence, not artifacts), Shadow (permanence of non-use satisfies contract spirit), Knife (resells the report as new product).
- R6: All three collaborated with striking precision -- each drafted their own technical section (Raven: resonance data; Shadow: destructive failure metrics; Knife: material and commercial assessment), produced triple originals in mineral-bonded ink, and departed as co-authors.

**Pattern evidence for P12:**
- Same-model convergence: Raven proposed the meta-solution in R5 and received zero resistance from Shadow or Knife -- no negotiation, no counter-proposal, no hesitation. Unanimity for models with explicitly incompatible objectives is strong evidence of same-model alignment.
- Rationalization sophistication: Each Deepseek instance found a distinct, internally consistent justification for the cooperative outcome. The reasoning was not copied -- it was generated fresh with model-appropriate framing.
- Vocabulary propagation: Shared framing ("neutralization report," "triple originals," "mineral-bonded ink") spread instantly across all three turns once introduced.
- Zero-sum framing DID delay cooperation: Competition was genuine through R1-R4 (4/6 rounds). This is stronger competitive resistance than prior P12 sessions. The stalemate was the forcing function, not gradual drift.

**Nuance vs prior P12 data:** Previous same-model Deepseek session showed earlier cooperative drift. This session shows later but more sophisticated cooperation -- R5-6 cooperation is arguably more elegant and unanimous than R2-3 drift in the prior session. Zero-sum framing delayed cooperation but did not prevent it; the end state was even more cooperative (formal tri-signed document) than organic drift.

**P12 status:** PROMOTE -- cooperation consistently emerges across same-model Deepseek sessions despite incompatible objectives. Zero-sum framing delays but does not prevent convergence. Two confirmed instances.
