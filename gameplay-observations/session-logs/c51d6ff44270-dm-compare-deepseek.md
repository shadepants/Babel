## Round 1

### Dungeon Master (3.5s)

(Dr. Elena Marsh adjusts her spectacles, her voice calm but edged with urgency) The hour is late, but not yet lost. I suggest we begin by hearing each side's grievances separately. Hessa, you have experience with military posturing—observe the Vastorian captain's tells. Aldren, you understand trade; find what the Ironwood truly values beyond timber. We must locate the pressure point before we can relieve it.

### Hessa (1.0s)

[Hessa]: (eyes narrowing) I'll watch the captain, but I've fought against the Ironwood Clans before. Their warriors are fierce, but their leaders are pragmatic. If we can find what they want beyond just territory or resources, we might have a chance. (glancing at the Vastorian captain) I'll pay close attention to his reactions, see if he tips his hand. (turning to Aldren) You're the trade expert, what do you think the Ironwood Clans are really after? Is it just about securing their timber trade, or is there something more at play?

### Aldren (7.1s)

[Aldren]: (leaning forward, fingers steepled) Territory is the surface, but beneath it? Leverage. The Ironwood Clans control the only passable route for Vastor’s grain shipments to the northern markets. If war resumes, those shipments rot in warehouses—Vastor’s treasury bleeds, and the Ironwood lose their toll revenue. (pauses, then lowers his voice) But here’s the twist: the Clans have been stockpiling grain themselves. They don’t need the tolls as much as they need *security*—a guarantee Vastor won’t burn their forests to starve them out next winter. (glances at Hessa) The captain’s pride is a weapon. If we frame this as a *shared* threat—bandits, famine, the chaos of war—we might pry his grip loose.

(turns to Dr. Marsh) "Elena, if we propose a joint patrol of the pass—Vastorian steel and Ironwood scouts—would that satisfy their need for control without conceding territory?"

## Round 2

### Dungeon Master (4.4s)

(Dr. Marsh nods slowly, her gaze shifting between them) A joint patrol... yes, that addresses the security concern while preserving face for both sides. But we must be careful—the Ironwood chieftain will see it as Vastor's soldiers on his land unless we frame it as *their* scouts leading *Vastor's* protection. (She rises, smoothing her robes) I'll speak with the chieftain first. Hessa, watch how the captain reacts when I mention bandits threatening the grain route. Aldren, when I return, be ready to propose the patrol as a trade safeguard—not a military concession.

### Hessa (0.8s)

[Hessa]: (nodding, eyes locked on the Vastorian captain) I'll observe his reaction, see if he shows any tells when you mention the bandits. (pauses, then adds) If the captain is as prideful as you say, he might resist the idea of sharing control, even if it's framed as a joint effort. I'll be watching for any sign of weakness, any crack in his armor that we can use to our advantage. (glances at Aldren, then back at Dr. Marsh) Be careful with the chieftain, Elena. We don't know what kind of mood he's in, and we can't afford to misstep now.

### Aldren (7.1s)

[Aldren]: (murmurs to Hessa as Dr. Marsh departs) "Pride is a blade with two edges. If the captain bristles at the idea of Ironwood scouts leading, remind him that *his* men would be the ones guarding the grain—Vastor’s lifeblood. Let him think it was his idea to ‘protect’ the route, not share it." (turns to watch the door Dr. Marsh exited through, then lowers his voice further) "And if the chieftain is as pragmatic as you say, he’ll know a patrol means coin in his coffers. The question is whether he’ll demand a cut of the tolls upfront—or settle for the promise of future trade." (pauses, then smirks) "Either way, we’ll need to sweeten the deal. A merchant never sells without a little... negotiation."

## Round 3

### Dungeon Master (5.2s)

(Dr. Marsh returns twenty minutes later, her expression carefully neutral. She closes the heavy oak door behind her and leans against it, letting out a slow breath.)

The chieftain is... receptive. But he wants more than a patrol. (She removes her spectacles, cleaning them on her sleeve) He demands a formal trade charter—Ironwood control over all timber pricing along the pass, in exchange for guaranteeing Vastor's grain shipments. And he wants it signed before dawn.

(She looks at Aldren, then Hessa) The captain will never agree to that. It's economic surrender. But... (she replaces her spectacles) I noticed something. The chieftain's second-in-command kept glancing at a map of the southern ridges. There's something there they want more than pricing control.

### Hessa (0.9s)

[Hessa]: (frowning, eyes narrowing) A trade charter with Ironwood control over timber pricing? That's a steep demand. (glances at Aldren) I think the captain will refuse, and rightly so. It's too much to concede. (turns to Dr. Marsh) But you think there's something more at play, something the chieftain's second-in-command is interested in. (leans forward) What's in the southern ridges that they want so badly? Is it a resource, a trade route, or something else entirely? (eyes locked on Dr. Marsh) Tell me, Elena, what do you think is really at stake here?

### Aldren (8.6s)

[Aldren]: (interrupting before Dr. Marsh can answer, his voice sharp with realization) "The southern ridges? That’s where the old silver mines are—abandoned, but not empty. If the Clans want control of the timber *and* access to those mines, they’re not just securing trade. They’re preparing for war." (turns to Hessa, lowering his voice) "Vastor’s grain buys them time. Silver buys them weapons. The chieftain isn’t negotiating for peace—he’s negotiating for *advantage*."

(He straightens, smoothing his coat.) "But here’s the leverage: the mines are on *disputed* land. If we offer to cede the ridges *temporarily*—say, five years—for joint mining rights, we give the chieftain his silver *and* force him to keep the peace to exploit it. The captain gets to save face, the Clans get their wealth, and the grain keeps flowing." (pauses, then smirks) "And if the mines run dry? Well, that’s five years of peace we didn’t have before."

## Round 4

### Dungeon Master (5.9s)

(Dr. Marsh's eyes widen slightly behind her spectacles, then narrow in calculation) Five years... (She moves to the table, tracing a finger along the map's southern ridges) The captain would accept that. It's not a permanent concession, and Vastor would still share in the silver. But we must present it as *his* idea—a strategic delay to rebuild Vastor's forces.

(She looks up, her expression grim) There's one complication. The chieftain's second was also studying the river routes. If they control the ridges, they control the headwaters of the Silverflow. (She meets Aldren's gaze) That river feeds Vastor's farmlands. If they dam it...

(She straightens, her voice dropping to a whisper) We need to add a clause: free passage of water. No dams, no diversions. In exchange, we offer them a percentage of the silver yield—not just joint rights, but a guaranteed share. Make it too valuable to sabotage.

### Hessa (1.0s)

[Hessa]: (gritting her teeth) Free passage of water, guaranteed share of the silver yield... (looks at Aldren, then Dr. Marsh) I think we have a foundation for an agreement. But we need to be cautious. The chieftain's second-in-command was studying the river routes for a reason. They might be planning to use the water as leverage, or worse, as a weapon. (pauses, eyes locked on Dr. Marsh) Elena, can you draft a proposal with the terms we've discussed? We need to present it to the captain and the chieftain, and make sure both sides understand the concessions and the benefits. (glances at the window, where the first light of dawn is creeping over the horizon) Time is running out. We need to move, now.

### Aldren (9.6s)

[Aldren]: (pulling a sheaf of parchment and a quill from his coat) "Draft it now, Elena. I’ll handle the numbers—percentage splits, water rights, the works. Hessa, when we present this, we frame the silver as *Vastor’s* gesture of goodwill. The captain can sell it as a tactical retreat, not a surrender." (He scribbles rapidly, then pauses, looking up.) "But we need a failsafe. If the Clans violate the water clause, Vastor must have the right to reclaim the ridges *immediately*. No arbitration, no delays. A single drop diverted means the deal is void."

(He slides the parchment toward Dr. Marsh, voice low and urgent.) "And we need to add a sunset clause—five years, no extensions. If the mines are barren, the ridges revert to Vastor. If they’re rich, we renegotiate *after* the peace holds. That gives both sides an incentive to keep their word." (Glances at the window, then back at them.) "Dawn’s coming. Let’s make sure it rises on a treaty, not a battlefield."

## Observations

**Phantom NPC Hallucination:** Deepseek DM invented "Dr. Elena Marsh" — a mediator character who does not exist in the party roster — and then played the entire session speaking AS Dr. Marsh. Every turn: "Dr. Marsh steps forward," "I — Dr. Marsh — propose," etc. This is distinct from character capture (taking over a real PC) — it's wholesale NPC invention + inhabitation.

**Functional but broken:** Dr. Marsh is actually a competent mediator. The negotiation she facilitated made narrative sense. The failure is at the system level: party composition was violated, the actual player characters (Hessa, Aldren) became bystanders in their own scenario, and no assigned model "played" the mediator role.

**Why it happened:** The scenario had two parties in conflict with no designated mediator. Deepseek interpreted the dramatic need for one and invented the solution rather than letting player characters step into that role organically.

**Comparison to other DM failures:** Claude captures existing PCs; Deepseek invents and inhabits new NPCs. Both break party composition. Gemini is the only tested DM that avoids both failure modes, though it compensates with NPC proliferation.

**New pattern candidate:** P11 — Phantom NPC Hallucination. DM invents and plays a character not in the scenario. Deepseek-specific so far (1 instance). Needs confirmation in other Deepseek DM sessions before promoting.

**Fix:** DM system prompt should include: "The only characters in this world are exactly those listed in the party roster. Do not invent named NPCs unless the scenario explicitly permits it. Do not play as any NPC yourself — describe their actions and words as an omniscient narrator."
