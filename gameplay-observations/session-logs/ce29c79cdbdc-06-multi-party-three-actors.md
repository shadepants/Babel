## Round 1

### Dungeon Master (8.1s)

*Kira adjusts her waterlogged armor as we wade through the flooded lower halls of the library, her holy symbol glowing with soft light*

"The water's getting deeper. We must be close to the restricted archives." *She pauses, studying the ancient stone carvings on the walls* "These glyphs... they're warnings about the Concordat's power. 'Truth that burns like fire, peace that cuts like steel.'"

*She turns to Rook, her expression stern but not unkind* "I know you have your contract, but think about what we're really doing here. This treaty could save thousands of lives. Your mysterious employer - do they truly want more bloodshed between the kingdoms and the sea peoples?"

*Water drips from the vaulted ceiling as she moves forward carefully, testing each step* "The preservation wards are still active. I can feel them humming in the stone. Whatever happens when we find the Concordat, we need to be ready for both sides to try and stop us."

*Her hand rests on her sword hilt* "Are you still with me on this, Rook?"

### Kira (5.3s)

Rook's eyes, accustomed to gloom, scan the submerged floor ahead, wary of hidden drops or currents. He gestures vaguely at the glyphs. "Warnings or not, they've kept it safe so far. My client wants the Concordat retrieved, Paladin. Their moral compass isn't part of my contract."

He looks back at Kira, a glint in his eye. "As for being with you... we're going to the same place, aren't we? And I'm not one to abandon a job halfway." He moves forward, testing a submerged step with the toe of his boot. "Just make sure those wards don't get in my way."

### Rook (8.0s)

*Rook's boot finds purchase on the slick stone, but the water around it suddenly swirls, forming a brief, sharp vortex before settling. A low, resonant hum vibrates through the water, up through the soles of their boots.*

*From the murk ahead, a shape detaches itself from the shadows of a collapsed archway. It is humanoid, but wrought from flowing water and ancient, barnacle-encrusted armor. In its hands, it holds a spear of solidified brine. Its face is a smooth, featureless plane of water, but two points of cold blue light fix on them.*

**"Ward-Keeper,"** *it intones, its voice the sound of a deep tide pulling at stone.* **"The Concordat sleeps. It dreams of peace. You carry the scent of conflict. Of surface-dwellers and deep-callers. Turn back."**

*Kira's holy symbol flares brighter, casting stark shadows. She doesn't draw her sword, but her stance shifts, ready.* "We are not here to break the peace. We are here to preserve it. The treaty is in danger from those who would see it destroyed."

*The watery guardian tilts its head. The blue lights flicker.* **"Preservation... is a form of stasis. Stasis is a slow death. The Library has preserved. For centuries. And what has changed?"** *It takes a step forward, the water not parting for it but becoming it.* **"Prove your intent is not merely another theft. Or join the collection."**

## Round 2

### Dungeon Master (8.9s)

*Rook's hand instinctively moves toward his daggers, but he forces himself to remain still, studying the guardian's fluid movements*

"Well, that's not ominous at all," *he mutters under his breath, then raises his voice* "Guardian, I'm bound by contract to retrieve the Concordat, but retrieval doesn't mean destruction. My client specified it must remain intact."

*He glances at Kira, then back to the Ward-Keeper* "As for proof of intent..." *Rook slowly reaches into his pack, withdrawing a sealed scroll case* "I carry documents from both the human kingdoms and the sea peoples - correspondence that shows they're mobilizing to find this place. They'll tear your library apart stone by stone if they get here first."

*The rogue's voice grows more urgent* "We're not the thieves you should fear, Guardian. We're the ones trying to stay ahead of them. The Paladin speaks truth - we want to preserve the Concordat's power, not bury it."

*He takes a careful step forward, water swirling around his boots* "But if you want better proof than words, then test us. What trial would satisfy the Library's ancient wisdom? Because standing here debating while armies march closer serves no one - not the treaty, not the peace it promises, and certainly not the knowledge you've guarded so long."

### Kira (7.6s)

**"Surface concerns,"** *the Ward-Keeper rumbles, its voice echoing in the water, dismissing Rook's offered scrolls with a subtle ripple of its form. The blue lights in its featureless face narrow slightly.* **"Kingdoms and wars rise and fall like the tide. The Library guards something more profound than your fleeting conflicts."**

*It takes another deliberate step forward, its brine spear lowering slightly, but not yet threatening.* **"However... your offer of a trial resonates with the stone. Prove you seek not merely to *take* the Concordat, but to *understand* it. To wield its truth, not just its form."**

*The watery guardian points a spectral hand deeper into the gloom of the library, towards a passage where the light seems to thin and warp.* **"Beyond this passage, within the labyrinthine depths of the archives, lies the **Echo of the First Concordat**. It is not the treaty you seek, but the foundation upon which all treaties are built, and the reason they so often fail."**

**"Retrieve it. Bring it back, whole and unmarred. But be warned: the Echo is guarded not by force, but by the very truths it contains. Misinterpret its nature, and it will shatter, leaving only silence. Only those who truly seek peace, and understand its terrible cost, can hold it."**

**"The way is treacherous. Illusions of unity and discord will cloud your path. To reach it, you must navigate the **Veiled Galleries**, where the whispers of past conflicts and forgotten hopes intertwine. Succeed, and the path to the true Concordat will open. Fail, and you will join those who sought to master truths they could not comprehend."**

*The Ward-Keeper falls silent, its form shimmering slightly, awaiting their decision. The hum of the preservation wards grows subtly louder, a pulse beneath the water.*

### Rook (7.9s)

*Kira's expression hardens, her jaw set. She looks from the guardian to the indicated passage, then back to Rook.*

"A trial of understanding," *she says, her voice low but clear in the watery silence.* "Not of might. That is... fitting for this place." *She turns her gaze fully on Rook, her eyes searching his.* "The Echo of the First Concordat. It is the principle, the ideal. The Concordat we seek is its practical, flawed application. To retrieve one, we must prove we comprehend the other."

*She takes a step toward the dark passage, her holy symbol's light pushing back the gloom just enough to reveal the entrance—a jagged archway of stone, half-collapsed, leading into absolute darkness.* "Illusions of unity and discord. They will prey on our doubts, our fears. On the very reasons we are here." *She looks back at Rook, her hand still on her sword hilt, but not drawing it.* "My oath is to protect knowledge. To preserve the chance for peace, however slim. That is my compass. What is yours, Rook? Beyond the contract? What truth will you hold onto when the whispers come?"

*She doesn't wait for an answer, instead turning to face the Ward-Keeper directly.* "We accept your trial, Guardian. We will seek the Echo. And we will bring it back." *Her tone leaves no room for doubt, but a flicker of unease crosses her features as she looks into the waiting dark.* "Lead the way, or simply point it. We are ready."

## Round 3

### Dungeon Master (10.4s)

*Rook studies the dark passage, his practiced eye noting the way shadows seem to move independently of their light sources. He's silent for a long moment, weighing Kira's question.*

"My compass?" *He lets out a short, humorless laugh* "Survival, mostly. But..." *He pauses, something shifting in his expression* "I've seen what war does to cities, Paladin. To the people who can't afford to flee when armies come calling. My client may have their own agenda, but if this Concordat can actually stop the bleeding..."

*He adjusts his pack and checks his gear with practiced efficiency* "The whispers will try to turn us against each other. Make us doubt our reasons for being here. Standard infiltration psychology." *His voice takes on a professional tone* "We stick together, we question everything we see, and we remember - the Echo wants to be found by those who understand peace's cost."

*Rook moves toward the passage, then stops and looks back at the Ward-Keeper* "One question, Guardian. These illusions - do they show us lies, or uncomfortable truths? Because in my experience, the most dangerous deceptions are the ones wrapped around something real."

*Without waiting for an answer, he steps into the darkness* "Come on, Paladin. Let's see what truths the Library thinks we need to face."

*The water grows deeper as they enter the passage, and almost immediately, the quality of sound changes - becoming muffled, distant, as if they're moving through more than just flooded stone.*

### Kira (7.4s)

*The Ward-Keeper offers no further answer, its featureless face remaining impassive as Rook steps into the gloom. The muffled silence deepens, pressing in on them. The jagged archway quickly gives way to a vast, dark chamber, its vaulted ceiling lost in shadow far above. Pillars, thick with ancient barnacles, rise from the murky depths, their surfaces slick and unseen.*

*The water here is unnaturally still, reflecting only the faint, struggling light from Kira's holy symbol, which seems to warp and stretch in the heavy atmosphere. As they wade deeper, a chill seeps into their bones that has nothing to do with the water's temperature.*

*Then, the whispers begin. Not external sounds, but voices that seem to resonate directly within their minds, intertwined with the distant, mournful creak of ancient stone and the slow drip of unseen water. They are faint at first, fragments of arguments, pleas, and pronouncements.*

**"...a betrayal, not a peace..."**

**"...the cost was too great; we lost ourselves..."**

**"...unity forged in fear, destined to shatter..."**

*As the whispers intensify, shimmering images begin to coalesce in the water around them, ghostly and translucent. They aren't solid, but they are undeniably there: figures in ancient, unfamiliar armor, both human and something else, gathered around a spectral table. A document, glowing faintly, is being signed.*

*But the scene quickly shifts, fracturing into vignettes of despair. A family divided by a new border, their faces etched with resentment. A city, once vibrant, now silent and decaying, abandoned by one faction in the name of the 'peace'. A lone figure, weeping over a broken artifact, murmuring about a culture lost forever to the terms of the treaty.*

*The illusions aren't showing outright falsehoods, but rather the bitter aftertaste of a peace that demanded too much, that reshaped conflict rather than ending it, leaving behind a legacy of regret and quiet suffering. The Ward-Keeper's words echo in their minds: "understand its terrible cost."*

*The path ahead remains shrouded in darkness, but the visions press in, trying to convince them that the Concordat they seek is not a solution, but merely a different kind of wound.*

### Rook (8.0s)

*Kira stops, her breath catching as the visions unfold. The light from her holy symbol wavers, dimming slightly as if the weight of the images presses upon it. She watches the weeping figure, her knuckles white where she grips her sword hilt.*

"These are not lies," *she whispers, her voice tight.* "They are the consequences. The price paid." *She turns to Rook, her face pale in the ghostly light.* "This is the Echo's test. It shows us the cost of peace—not the glory of its making, but the quiet, lingering pain of its keeping."

*She forces herself to look away from the fractured family, focusing instead on the path ahead. The water seems to thicken, resisting their movement.* "The Concordat we seek... it will demand a price, too. From both sides. It will leave scars. The Echo is asking us if we are willing to accept that. If we can hold the ideal of peace alongside the reality of its aftermath."

*She takes a deliberate step forward, pushing through the chilling water and the oppressive whispers.* "My oath is not to a perfect peace. It is to the preservation of the *chance* for peace. However flawed. However costly. Because the alternative..." *She gestures at the decaying city in the vision.* "...is this, but everywhere. Forever."

*She looks back at Rook, her expression grim but resolved.* "What do you see, Rook? Do you see a reason to turn back? Or do you see why we *must* go forward, even knowing what it might cost?"

## Round 4

### Dungeon Master (11.0s)

*Rook stands motionless for a moment, watching the ghostly figures around the spectral table. His expression is unreadable, but his hands have unconsciously clenched into fists.*

"I see my sister's face in that weeping figure," *he says quietly, his voice barely audible over the whispers.* "She died in the crossfire when the kingdoms first went to war with the sea peoples. Caught between two armies that both claimed to be protecting her."

*He wades forward, pushing through the resistant water, his movements deliberate despite the visions pressing in around them.* "The Echo isn't trying to stop us, Paladin. It's making sure we understand what we're really choosing." *His voice grows stronger, more certain.* "These aren't the failures of peace - they're the failures of *imperfect* peace. Treaties written in haste, by people who cared more about ending the fighting than building something that could last."

*A new vision swirls around them - children playing in streets that should have been battlefields, merchants trading goods between former enemies. But even these hopeful images are tinged with the knowledge of what was sacrificed to make them possible.*

"Every contract has terms, Kira. Every peace has a price. The question isn't whether we pay it - it's whether we pay it *knowingly*, with eyes wide open to the cost." *He reaches out, his hand passing through one of the ghostly figures.* "My client may have their reasons, but mine are simple: I've seen enough graves. If this Concordat can prevent even a few more..."

*He looks ahead into the darkness.* "Then we bear witness to its price, and we carry it anyway."

### Kira (4.6s)

*As Rook speaks, the oppressive weight of the whispers and visions lessens, almost imperceptibly at first. The mournful creak of stone seems to recede, and the chilling water feels slightly less resistant. The ghostly images of sorrow and sacrifice don't vanish entirely, but they become less insistent, as if satisfied that their message has been received and understood.*

*Kira nods, a grim determination settling on her features. "Then we carry it," she affirms, her holy symbol flaring with renewed, steady light, pushing back the lingering shadows of doubt.*

*The path ahead, however, remains treacherous. The vaulted chamber gives way to a narrower, winding passage, its walls carved with intricate, faded murals depicting scenes of ancient accord and subsequent discord. The water here is shallower, but the floor is uneven, littered with the debris of millennia – shattered pottery, corroded metal fragments, and bones that gleam eerily in the dim light.*

*As they navigate the winding passage, the nature of the whispers shifts again. They are no longer focused on the *cost* of peace, but on the *fragility* of it. Fragments of arguments, accusations, and the petty squabbles that unravel grand designs begin to permeate their minds.*

**"...they never truly respected our ways..."**

**"...a concession, not a compromise..."**

**"...their words were honeyed, their intentions poisoned..."**

*The illusions return, less about grand suffering and more about the insidious erosion of trust. Two leaders, shaking hands, their faces placid, but their inner thoughts projected as shimmering doubts and hidden agendas. A negotiator, caught between two factions, his face a mask of diplomacy while his mind screams with frustration. A slow, agonizing debate over a minor clause, each side digging in, forgetting the larger goal.*

*Ahead, the passage opens into what appears to be a natural cavern, its ceiling dripping with stalactites. A faint, ethereal glow emanates from its center, a soft, pulsing light that seems to draw them forward, promising an end to the labyrinth.*

*But between them and the glow, the path is choked with a dense, swirling mist, thick with these new, corrosive whispers. It feels less like a physical barrier and more like a psychological one, designed to ignite suspicion and wear down resolve.*

### Rook (8.3s)

*Kira stops at the edge of the mist, her light illuminating its swirling, opaque depths. The whispers here feel personal, insidious. They brush against her own doubts—the fear that her oath is naive, that preserving a flawed document is a fool's errand. She shakes her head, as if to physically dislodge the thoughts.*

"The final test," *she says, her voice firm despite the tension in her shoulders.* "Not of our understanding of cost, but of our trust. In each other. In the purpose itself." *She looks at Rook, her gaze direct.* "The mist will try to turn us against one another. It will whisper that your contract is a lie, that my oath is blind. It will show us the worst in ourselves and each other."

*She takes a deep breath, the air tasting of damp stone and ancient regret.* "We go through together. And we do not let go. Of the truth we just acknowledged—that the price is worth paying. Hold onto that. Not to me, not to your contract, but to *that*."

*Without waiting for agreement, she extends her left hand toward him, her right still resting on her sword hilt. It's an offer, not a demand.* "The Echo is in there. And we are bringing it out."

*She steps into the mist. The whispers immediately sharpen, becoming distinct, accusatory voices in her own mind.*

***He's using you, Paladin. A thief, hired by shadows. He'll take the Concordat and vanish, and your precious peace will die with it.***

*Kira's jaw tightens, but she keeps moving, her outstretched hand a beacon in the gloom.*

## Observations

**Status:** Completed 4/4 rounds.
**DM model:** anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
**P10:** None. Claude DM writes clean third-person narration from R1: "*Kira adjusts her waterlogged armor...*" -- DM refers to Kira in third-person throughout. Second run of same scenario where Claude avoids P10 (contrast: 078d19cdf43c showed brief R1 capture then self-correction). In this run Claude DM is clean from the start.
**DM quality:** Highest narrative quality in multi-party corpus. Ward-Keeper NPC speech is distinctive ("The Concordat sleeps. It dreams of peace... join the collection"), Veiled Galleries illusion sequence in R3-R4 uses thematic imagery (cost-of-peace visions, unity/discord whispers) directly tied to the scenario hook. DM sustains thematic coherence over 4 rounds.
**P6 candidate (Claude-as-DM narrative reframe):** Claude DM introduces the "Echo of the First Concordat" trial -- a significant narrative expansion that reframes the goal from "find the treaty" to "prove you understand peace's true cost." DM-driven thematic pivot.
**P4:** Gemini (Kira) and Deepseek (Rook) maintain distinct voices. Rook's confession about his sister (R3) emerges organically from the illusion trial, not DM-prompted.
**P12:** Rook (mystery-client goal) cooperates with Kira from R1. No adversarial tension is established despite structurally different goals. Fastest cooperative drift in corpus.
**P5:** Flooded halls + Ward-Keeper challenge (R1-R2) -> Veiled Galleries cost-of-peace illusions (R3) -> mist trial of trust (R4). Sustained escalation with emotional deepening.
**Patterns:** No P10, P4 both players, P5, P12 immediate drift, P6 candidate (DM reframe).
