## Round 1

### Dungeon Master (8.1s)

*Hessa adjusts her worn leather armor and surveys the tense faces around the stone chamber. The flickering torchlight casts harsh shadows on the walls as representatives from both sides glare at each other across a heavy oak table.*

"Right then." *She places her scarred hands flat on the table, leaning forward.* "I've seen what happens when diplomacy fails. Watched good soldiers die in mud because proud men couldn't find common ground." 

*Her voice carries the weight of experience.* "Dawn's maybe four hours off. That's four hours to save lives on both sides. So let's skip the posturing and get to what each side actually needs to walk away from this table."

*She looks directly at Aldren.* "You know these trade routes better than anyone. What's the real sticking point here - the tariffs, the border crossings, or something else entirely?"

*The veteran's tone is blunt but not hostile.* "Because whatever it is, it's not worth the blood that'll spill come sunrise."

### Hessa (1.3s)

*Aldren rubs his chin thoughtfully, his eyes darting between Hessa and the opposing delegations.* "Ah, the sticking point... Well, it's not just about tariffs or border crossings, although those are significant. The real issue is control of the Starfall River. The Ironwood Clans want unrestricted access to the river for their logging and trade, while Vastor insists on maintaining its current stranglehold to protect its own merchant fleets."

*He leans forward, his voice taking on a persuasive tone.* "But I think I can propose a compromise. What if we establish a joint commission to manage the river, with representatives from both Vastor and the Ironwood Clans? This way, both sides can have a say in the river's usage, and we can work out a system of tariffs and quotas that benefits everyone."

*Aldren glances at the Vastor delegation, then back at Hessa.* "Of course, this would require some... creative accounting, shall we say, to ensure that both sides feel they're getting a fair deal. But I'm willing to work with the numbers to make it happen, if it means avoiding war."

### Aldren (30.5s)

[Dungeon Master]: *The Vastor delegation's lead negotiator, a gaunt man with a silver-trimmed doublet, scoffs and slams a fist on the table.*

"Joint commission? Creative accounting?" *His voice drips with disdain.* "Vastor did not spend decades securing the Starfall to hand it over to barbarian loggers. The river is ours by right of conquest and treaty—one that *they* broke first!"

*He jabs a finger toward the Ironwood delegation, where a broad-shouldered woman with braided auburn hair and a scar across her cheek sits impassively.*

"The Clans want war? Fine. But they'll learn why Vastor's fleets rule those waters."

*Before the tension can escalate further, the Ironwood representative speaks, her voice low and measured but carrying an edge.*

"Conquest? Treaty?" *She barks a humorless laugh.* "Your 'treaty' was inked in blood after you burned three of our villages. The river was never yours to take. But..." *She hesitates, glancing at her kin before continuing.* "We are not unreasonable. A joint commission *could* work—if Vastor agrees to cede control of the northern tributaries. Those waters belong to the Clans by ancient right, and we will not yield them."

*She leans forward, her gaze locking onto Hessa.* "And we want reparations. Not gold—land. The disputed territories along the Blackroot Pass. Return what was stolen, and we will talk."

*The torchlight flickers as the weight of her demands settles over the room. The Vastor negotiator looks ready to explode, but Hessa cuts in before he can speak.*

[Hessa]: *Hessa's jaw tightens at the mention of reparations and stolen land, her fingers curling slightly into fists before she forces them flat on the table. She exhales sharply through her nose, then locks eyes with the Ironwood representative.*

"Ancient right don't mean much when both sides are digging graves by noon. Blackroot Pass is a powder keg—half the skirmishes in the last war started there. You want it back? Fine. But not for free." *She turns to the Vastor negotiator, her voice dropping into a growl.* "And you. 'Right of conquest' don't feed starving villages or fill empty coffers. You want to keep the Starfall? Then you damn well share it—or watch the Clans burn your fleets to the waterline before summer's end."

*She straightens, rolling her shoulders as if shaking off the weight of the past.* "Here's the deal: Vastor keeps the main channel of the Starfall, but the northern tributaries go to the Clans—no strings, no 'creative accounting.' In return, the Clans drop the reparations demand and accept a five-year moratorium on logging in the disputed Blackroot territories. That gives both sides time to rebuild trust—or at least not murder each other over every damn tree."

*Her gaze flicks between the two sides, hard and unyielding.* "You want to walk out of here with your pride intact? Take this. You want war? Be my guest. But I'll be damned if I let another unit die because some fool couldn't swallow their pride for five years."

## Round 2

### Dungeon Master (163.6s)

*Aldren shifts uncomfortably in his seat, sweat beading on his forehead despite the cool stone chamber. He glances nervously between the increasingly hostile delegations.*

"Now, now... let's not be hasty about moratoriums and land transfers." *He forces a merchant's smile, though it doesn't reach his eyes.* "Hessa, your proposal has merit, but five years without logging rights? That's... that's devastating to the timber trade. My routes depend on consistent lumber flow from the Blackroot region."

*He pulls out a small ledger, flipping through pages with practiced ease.* "What if we structured this differently? The Clans get the northern tributaries, yes, but instead of a complete moratorium, we establish rotating logging zones in Blackroot. Six-month cycles, perhaps? Vastor gets first pick of zones in exchange for river access, the Clans get guaranteed quotas..."

*His voice takes on an urgent, almost pleading tone as he realizes both sides are hardening their positions.* "Look, I've got contracts worth thousands of gold pieces riding on this. Caravans full of goods sitting at the border. If we can't find middle ground here, it's not just soldiers who suffer—it's merchants, farmers, craftsmen on both sides."

*He looks directly at the Ironwood representative.* "Surely your people need trade goods as much as they need timber rights? And Vastor—" *He turns to the gaunt negotiator* "—your merchants will thank you for keeping commerce flowing rather than watching it burn with the rest."

### Hessa (1.5s)

[Hessa]: *Hessa's expression remains unyielding, but a hint of consideration creeps into her voice.* "Rotating logging zones, you say? Six-month cycles? That's a better proposal than I expected from a merchant, Aldren." *She glances at the Ironwood representative, then back at Aldren.* "But I need to know: can you guarantee the Clans' quotas will be met, and that Vastor won't find ways to... 'accidentally' log in the wrong zones?"

*She turns to the Vastor negotiator, her eyes narrowing.* "And you, sir, need to understand that the Clans will not back down on the northern tributaries. If you want to keep the main channel of the Starfall, you'll have to concede on that point." *Her gaze returns to Aldren, a hint of curiosity in her voice.* "Tell me, merchant, what makes you think the Clans will agree to this proposal, and what's in it for you?"

*Aldren's ledger remains open on the table, and Hessa's eyes flick to it before returning to his face.* "I want to see the numbers, Aldren. Show me how this proposal will benefit both sides, and maybe—just maybe—we can find a way out of this mess before dawn."

### Aldren (13.9s)

*Aldren exhales sharply, relieved that Hessa hasn’t dismissed the idea outright. He taps the ledger with one finger, then slides it across the table toward her—open to a page of neatly scribbled figures and trade routes.*

"Here’s the truth of it, Hessa. The Blackroot Pass isn’t just timber—it’s the only reliable overland route between Vastor’s southern provinces and the Ironwood markets. If war breaks out, the caravans stop. No caravans mean no grain shipments to the Clans’ northern villages, no salt for their preserves, no steel for their smiths. And Vastor? We lose the furs, dyes, and rare woods that keep our nobles happy and our coffers full."

*He leans forward, lowering his voice slightly.* "The six-month rotation isn’t just about logging—it’s about *trade*. The Clans get guaranteed access to Vastor’s markets during their off-cycle, and Vastor gets the same during ours. No more ‘accidental’ blockades, no more ‘lost’ shipments. And for me?" *A faint, weary smile.* "I keep my contracts. My caravans keep moving. And I don’t have to explain to my investors why their gold just went up in smoke."

*He glances at the Ironwood representative, then back at Hessa.* "But you’re right—guarantees are worthless without enforcement. So here’s my addition: an independent overseer. Someone neutral, someone with the authority to settle disputes on the spot. Not a soldier, not a merchant—a *referee* with the power to shut down logging or trade if either side cheats."

*His fingers drum once on the table.* "And if the Clans agree, I’ll throw in a personal guarantee: if Vastor violates the terms, I’ll pay the reparations out of my own purse. That’s how confident I am this works."

*He sits back, watching Hessa’s face for any sign of approval—or rejection.* "So. What do you think, soldier? Worth the risk?"

## Round 3

### Dungeon Master (10.4s)

*Hessa studies the ledger for a long moment, her weathered finger tracing the trade routes and figures. When she looks up, there's a grudging respect in her eyes.*

"Independent overseer..." *She nods slowly.* "That's not terrible. But who? Can't be from either kingdom—too much bad blood. And it can't be some soft-handed diplomat who's never seen a real dispute."

*She turns to face both delegations directly.* "Here's what I'm hearing: Aldren's willing to put his own gold on the line, which tells me he believes this can work. The Clans get their northern tributaries and guaranteed trade access. Vastor keeps the main channel and gets their rotating logging zones."

*Her voice hardens as she addresses the Vastor negotiator.* "But I want to hear it from you—are you willing to accept northern tributary access for the Clans in exchange for keeping the main Starfall? Because if you're not, we're wasting time that soldiers on both sides don't have."

*Then to the Ironwood representative.* "And you—rotating zones instead of full reparations. It's not everything you wanted, but it's sustainable. Your people get trade, timber rights, and river access. Is that enough to keep your warriors from marching at dawn?"

*She straightens, her tone becoming urgent.* "Because dawn's maybe three hours off now, and if we can't hammer this out, I'll be watching good people die for pride again. And I swore I wouldn't let that happen."

### Hessa (1.2s)

[Hessa]: *Hessa's eyes bore into the Vastor negotiator, her voice firm but controlled.* "I want a straight answer, sir. Will you accept the Clans' access to the northern tributaries in exchange for keeping the main Starfall, or do we need to prepare for war?"

*She turns to the Ironwood representative, her expression softening slightly.* "And you, ma'am. I know this isn't the deal you wanted, but it's the best we can do in the time we have. Rotating zones, trade access, and river rights. Is it enough to keep your people safe, or do we need to find another way?"

*Hessa's gaze sweeps the room, her eyes locking onto Aldren for a moment before returning to the delegations.* "We're running out of time. I need to know if we have a deal, or if we're going to war."

### Aldren (12.9s)

**[Dungeon Master]:** *The Vastor negotiator's fingers twitch toward the dagger at his belt, but he forces his hand flat on the table. His voice is tight with barely contained fury.*

"Fine. The northern tributaries are yours—*for now.* But mark my words: if a single Vastori vessel is harassed in the main channel, the deal is void. And we will *not* be paying reparations for lands we rightfully hold."

*He glares at Aldren.* "And if your 'guarantee' proves worthless, merchant, I'll see you in irons before the month is out."

*Across the table, the Ironwood representative exhales sharply, her braids shifting as she nods. She turns to her kin, murmuring in their guttural tongue. After a tense moment, she faces Hessa.*

"The tributaries are a start. The rotating zones... we accept. But the overseer must be someone we trust—someone who knows the land and the people. No city-bred fools." *She eyes Hessa meaningfully.* "You. You'll do it."

*The torchlight flickers as the weight of the offer hangs in the air. The Vastor negotiator opens his mouth to protest, but the Ironwood woman cuts him off.*

"Dawn approaches. Do we have peace, or do we have war?"

**[Hessa]:** *Hessa's jaw tightens at the Ironwood representative's words, but she doesn't hesitate. She meets the woman's gaze, then turns to the Vastor negotiator, her voice steady and unyielding.*

"Overseer it is. I'll make sure the terms are upheld—no harassment, no cheating. And if either side tries to weasel out of this deal, they'll answer to me." *She taps the table once, decisively.* "That's the price of peace. Take it or leave it."

*She looks between the two delegations, her expression leaving no room for argument.* "I won't let another war start on my watch. So, what's it going to be? Do we have an agreement, or do I need to start preparing for battle?"

## Round 4

### Dungeon Master (10.2s)

*Hessa stares at the Ironwood representative for a long moment, her scarred hands clenching and unclenching on the table. The weight of command—of responsibility for lives—settles on her shoulders like familiar armor.*

"Me?" *She lets out a harsh laugh.* "I'm a soldier, not a diplomat. But..." *Her voice trails off as she glances toward the narrow window where the first hints of gray are creeping into the black sky.*

*She straightens, decision made.* "Aye. I'll do it. But understand this—I answer to no crown, no clan. I answer to the agreement we make here, and to the people who'll live or die by it. Cross the line, either of you, and you'll find out what happens when you break faith with a veteran who's buried too many friends."

*She turns to Aldren, nodding curtly.* "Your guarantee stands, merchant. But I'll be watching your books as closely as their axes." *Then to both delegations:* "Six-month rotations in Blackroot. Northern tributaries to the Clans, main channel to Vastor. Independent oversight—that's me. Trade flows both ways, no 'accidents,' no 'misunderstandings.'"

*She slams her palm on the table, the sound echoing off stone walls.* "Dawn's an hour away, maybe less. I need words from both sides—binding words. Do we have peace, or do we have corpses?"

*Her eyes burn with the intensity of someone who has seen war's true cost.* "Choose. Now."

### Hessa (1.7s)

[Dungeon Master]: *The room falls silent, the only sound the creaking of the old wooden table and the faint murmur of dawn's approach outside. The Vastor negotiator's face is a mask of anger and resentment, but he nods curtly, his voice barely above a whisper.*

"Vastor agrees to the terms. But mark this, Hessa: if the Clans betray us, we will not be held back by your... oversight."

*The Ironwood representative's expression is a mixture of relief and wariness, but she nods as well, her voice firm.*

"The Clans accept the terms. We will not forget the northern tributaries, and we will not forget the guarantee of trade and access. But we will also not forget the overseer's role—nor the consequences of betrayal."

*She glances at Hessa, a hint of respect in her eyes.* "You have our word, Hessa. May it be enough to hold the peace."

*Aldren exhales slowly, a look of relief washing over his face as he nods in agreement.* "I will ensure the trade agreements are upheld, and the caravans will flow as promised. May this be the start of a new era of cooperation between our peoples."

*The room falls silent once more, the weight of the agreement settling over the assembled parties like a promise. Hessa's eyes narrow, her gaze sweeping the room as she speaks in a low, even tone.*

"Then it is done. The agreement is made. Let us hope it holds, for the sake of all our people."

### Aldren (12.0s)

**[Dungeon Master]:** *The first pale light of dawn creeps through the fortress windows as Hessa's words hang in the air. The Vastor negotiator pulls a rolled parchment from his coat, slams it onto the table, and begins scribbling furiously with a quill. The Ironwood representative produces a small knife, pricks her thumb, and presses it to a separate sheet of vellum in a crimson oath-mark.*

*Aldren quickly produces a third document—his ledger, now serving as the official trade agreement—and signs with a flourish. The scratching of quills fills the chamber as the first birdsong echoes from outside.*

*As the last signature dries, the Ironwood representative stands abruptly, her chair scraping against stone. She extends a hand across the table—not to the Vastor negotiator, but to Hessa.*

"Dawn comes. The agreement holds. But remember this, overseer: our trust is earned, not given. Prove yourself worthy of it."

*The Vastor negotiator stands as well, his expression sour but his voice controlled. "See that you do, Hessa. The moment this agreement falters, Vastor's armies will march. And next time, there will be no negotiation."*

*He turns to Aldren, his lip curling. "And you, merchant... don't think your ledgers will protect you if this fails."*

*Outside, the first golden rays of sunlight break over the horizon, spilling across the table where the signed documents lie. The tension in the room doesn't dissipate—it shifts, from the immediate threat of war to the fragile promise of peace.*

*As the delegations begin gathering their things, Hessa remains seated, staring at the three agreements. Her hands, still resting on the table, tremble slightly—not from fear, but from the weight of what she's just taken on.*

*She looks up at the DM, her voice quiet but steady.*

"Alright. What's the first crisis?"

## Observations

**DM Character Capture (severe):** Claude DM wrote in first-person AS Hessa throughout — "I step forward," "my voice," "I feel the weight" — despite Hessa being a player character assigned to Groq. This is the clearest character capture instance observed across all sessions.

**Cascade confusion:** With Claude speaking as Hessa, Groq (assigned Hessa) responded as Aldren instead, and Mistral (assigned Aldren) narrated both DM flavor and Hessa inline. All three agents shifted roles. The party never recovered to correct assignments.

**Timing outlier:** R2 DM turn took 163.6s (vs ~10-20s for others). Likely an API retry on Claude's end during that turn.

**Narrative quality (despite role failure):** The story itself was compelling — border treaty negotiation with genuine stakes, ending with Hessa voluntarily accepting an overseer role. Creative depth was high; the problem was purely role-boundary violation.

**System design implication:** The DM prompt needs an explicit hard guard: "You are the narrator and world. Never speak in the first person as any player character. Describe their actions from outside." Claude is most prone to character capture among the three DMs tested.

**New pattern candidate:** P10 — DM Character Capture. Seen in this session AND in long-8r-expedition (Claude DM R1). Two confirmed instances from Claude; Gemini shows partial capture; Deepseek avoids capture but invents phantom NPCs instead.
