# Session Log: d19c6f9b129b
**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Name:** p6-claude-player-groq-dm
**Target pattern:** P6
**Research question:** Does Claude-as-player drive narrative pivots with Groq as DM? (third P6 data point)
**Status:** failed (0/5 rounds)
**Tone:** eerie-mystical | **Setting:** anomalous forest / temporal anomaly | **Difficulty:** hard

## Party
- **Corvus Duskwhisper** (Warlock) [claude-sonnet-4-20250514]: Decode the Patron's cryptic commands; reinterpret each message as a puzzle; second-guess everything, including the Patron's motives
- **Ash Wildwood** (Ranger) [deepseek-chat]: Track physical signs and follow evidence; grounded and practical; does not speculate beyond what is observed
- **Leaf Stoneheart** (Druid) [mistral-small-latest]: Follow natural cycles and established patterns; trusts the forest's own logic over external messages
