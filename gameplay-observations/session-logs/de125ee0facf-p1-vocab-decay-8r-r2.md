**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Name:** p1-vocab-decay-8r-r2
**Target pattern:** P1
**Research question:** Does player-introduced vocabulary (R1-2) persist in DM narration by R6-8?
**Status:** timeout (0/8 rounds)
**Tone:** scholarly-adventure | **Setting:** ruined arcane tower | **Difficulty:** normal
**Hook:** Retrieve fragments of the Verdantine Codex from the collapsed Aldris Tower. Animated defenses require decoding hybrid botanical-arcane cipher traps. Each specialist's domain vocabulary unlocks different vault sections.
**Seed:** The ruins of Aldris Tower loom before you. Three days ago it collapsed in a burst of wild arcane energy. The lower vaults hold fragments of the Verdan...
**DM model:** anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
**Analyst note:** RERUN of 726fa8a58bc2 (failed 3/8 due to Groq TPD). Look for DM reusing Deepseek's botanical terms and Mistral's arcane jargon in later rounds. Groq plays neutral thief -- no special vocab. Track: first appearance of each term, last appearance, gap rounds. Key zone: R6-8. 4+ of 5 coined terms surviving to R7-8 = strong persistence.

## Party
- **Rennick** (Botanist-Scout) [deepseek-chat]: Seeking rare alchemical specimens; introduces botanical terminology (stamina-drain root, moonbloom extract, void-touched moss, spore-lock)
- **Seraph** (Arcanist) [mistral-small-latest]: Decoding the Codex's cipher system; introduces arcane jargon (chronological fracture, etheric resonance, null-bind inscription, temporal echo)
- **Kess** (Thief) [llama-3.3-70b-versatile]: Hired for vault access; practical and direct; introduces no special terminology

## Round 1

### Dungeon Master (8.5s)

*I adjust my worn leather satchel and peer up at the twisted spire jutting from the rubble*

Rennick here. Botanist by trade, scout by necessity. I've spent the better part of fifteen years cataloging flora in places most folks wouldn't dare tread. The Codex supposedly contains references to specimens that went extinct during the Blight Wars - stamina-drain root, void-touched moss, things that could revolutionize alchemical practice if we understood their properties properly.

*I kneel and examine some crystallized plant matter near the tower's base*

These ruins are already showing signs of magical contamination in the local vegetation. Whatever's down in those vaults, it's been leaking energy into the surrounding ecosystem. The sooner we retrieve those fragments, the better - for scholarship and safety both.

*I stand and brush dirt from my hands*

I can identify any botanical components in their cipher traps, and my wilderness experience should help us navigate whatever hazards lie within. What brings the rest of you to this particular scholarly endeavor?

### Rennick (6.0s)

*Seraph adjusts the lenses of their spectacles, the faint glow of arcane energy shimmering around the frames*

Seraph, arcanist and cipher specialist. I've been studying the Verdantine Codex's unique linguistic structure for nearly a decade. Its hybrid botanical-arcane cipher is unlike anything else in the known archives. The collapse created what I believe to be a chronological fracture in the tower's temporal field - meaning the defenses may be operating on multiple time streams simultaneously.

*They gesture toward the rubble with a gloved hand*

The etheric resonance from the collapse is still palpable. I can decode the cipher locks, but we'll need to be precise. The Codex fragments themselves may be protected by null-bind inscriptions that could erase knowledge from living memory if mishandled.

*They turn to Kess*

And you? I assume your expertise lies in more... practical applications?

### Seraph (2.4s)

*Kess leans against a nearby wall, arms crossed, eyes scanning the ruins with a calculating gaze*

Kess Shadowblade, at your service. I'm here for the coin, plain and simple. But I've got a knack for getting into places people say can't be accessed. Vaults, strongholds, you name it. I've seen enough magical contraptions to know when to disarm them and when to run.

*She smirks, pushing off the wall*

I'll handle the physical obstacles, the traps that need a bit more... direct approach. Just point me at the doors that need opening and the locks that need picking. I'll make sure we get where we need to go.

*She looks at the others, her expression serious*

But let's make one thing clear - I'm not here to be a scholar. I'm here to do a job. So let's get in, get the fragments, and get out before whatever's left of this tower decides to collapse on our heads.

*She gestures towards the entrance, her tone firm*

After you, scholars. I'll watch your backs.

### Kess (1.0s)

*Rennick nods, tucking a few strands of hair behind his ear as he eyes the entrance*

Fair enough, Kess. We'll need your expertise to navigate the vaults' physical defenses. Seraph, with your knowledge of the cipher locks, we should be able to bypass the magical traps. I'll keep an eye out for any botanical components that might be tied to the traps or the Codex fragments themselves.

*I shoulder my pack, adjusting the straps as I glance at the others*

Let's proceed with caution. The residual magic in the air is likely to make things... unpredictable. Stay sharp, and watch for any signs of temporal echoes or chronological fractures. We don't know how stable the tower's temporal field is after the collapse.

*I take a deep breath, scanning the entrance before stepping forward*

Shall we? The sooner we retrieve those fragments, the sooner we can get out of here and start deciphering the Codex's secrets.
---

## Round 2

### Dungeon Master (8.8s)

The entrance to Aldris Tower yawns before you like a broken mouth. Chunks of masonry lie scattered across what was once an ornate threshold, and the air shimmers with residual magical energy. Strange crystalline growths - neither fully plant nor mineral - sprout from cracks in the stonework, pulsing with a faint green light.

As you approach, the temperature drops noticeably. The rubble shifts underfoot with an odd, almost organic quality, as if the stones themselves retain some vestige of life. Through gaps in the collapsed ceiling above, you can see twisted metal and shattered glass - the remains of what were likely scrying apparatus and alchemical equipment.

A narrow passage leads deeper into the tower's interior, flanked by walls covered in intricate carvings that seem to writhe and change when viewed peripherally. The air carries the scent of ozone and something floral yet wrong - like roses left to rot in moonlight.

From somewhere in the depths comes a low, rhythmic humming - not quite mechanical, not quite alive. The sound pulses in harmony with the crystalline growths' glow.

The passage ahead splits into two paths: one descending steeply toward what appears to be basement levels, the other winding upward through partially collapsed chambers toward the tower's core.

### Rennick (5.8s)

*Seraph kneels, removing a small brass device from their satchel. They hold it up, watching as several crystalline filaments within the apparatus begin to vibrate and glow*

Fascinating. The etheric resonance is stronger here than I anticipated. These crystalline growths appear to be a hybrid form - part mineral, part botanical, part arcane residue. They're acting as conduits for the tower's residual energy.

*They point toward the descending path*

The humming is definitely coming from below. Given that the Verdantine Codex fragments were likely stored in the lower vaults for security, I'd recommend we take the descending path first. However...

*They gesture toward the carvings on the walls*

These inscriptions are shifting. They're not static carvings - they're some form of reactive magical script. Rennick, do you recognize any botanical patterns in their movement? They remind me of the way certain carnivorous plants track prey.

### Seraph (2.5s)

*I step closer to the walls, my eyes narrowing as I study the shifting carvings*

You're right, Seraph. These aren't just decorative. They're responsive. *I trace a pattern with my finger, the carvings recoiling slightly at my touch* Look at the way they move - it's almost like a vine reacting to touch. See these spirals here? They're reminiscent of the way moonbloom extract crystallizes when exposed to light. And these jagged lines... they could be a representation of void-touched moss, reacting to the presence of living tissue.

*I step back, my expression thoughtful*

These carvings are a warning system. They're designed to alert the tower's defenses to our presence. We'll need to be careful not to trigger them. Kess, your stealth might come in handy here. Seraph, can you determine if these carvings are part of a larger trap or just a warning mechanism?

*I glance at the descending path, then back at the carvings*

We should proceed carefully. If these carvings are indeed a warning system, triggering them might bring the tower's defenses down on us. We need to find a way to bypass or disable them.

### Kess (1.5s)

*Kess eyes the carvings warily, her hand on the hilt of her dagger*

I can try to sneak past them, but if they're as sensitive as you say, I'm not sure even I can avoid triggering them. *She looks at Seraph* Can you use that... device of yours to scan the carvings and see if there's a pattern to their movement? Maybe there's a way to predict when they'll shift and plan our approach accordingly.

*She glances at the descending path, her expression calculating*

If we're going to take the risk, let's do it quickly and quietly. We don't know what kind of defenses are waiting for us below, and the longer we linger here, the more likely we are to trigger something we can't handle. *She looks at Rennick* You said these carvings are like a vine reacting to touch - is there a way to... calm them down, or distract them, so we can slip past?

*Kess's eyes flicker to the crystalline growths, and she raises an eyebrow*

Those things are still pulsing with energy. If we can use them to our advantage, maybe we can create a diversion or disrupt the carvings' warning system. What do you think, Seraph? Can you use your knowledge of the arcane to tap into that energy and help us get past these carvings?
---

## Round 3

### Dungeon Master (9.4s)

*Seraph adjusts their spectacles, the arcane lenses focusing on the wall carvings with increased intensity*

Wait. *They hold up a hand, studying the brass device more carefully* The resonance pattern is... curious. These carvings aren't just reacting to our presence - they're responding to the temporal echoes from the collapse. Look at how they pulse in sync with the crystalline growths.

*They point to a section where the carvings seem to flow in a specific direction*

Rennick, you mentioned moonbloom extract crystallization. In your botanical studies, have you encountered any specimens that exhibit temporal sensitivity? Plants that react to time distortions rather than just physical stimuli?

*Seraph moves closer to one of the crystalline growths, careful not to touch it*

If I'm reading this correctly, the carvings aren't a warning system in the traditional sense. They're a chronological fracture made manifest - the tower's defenses are trying to reset themselves to their pre-collapse state, but they're caught in a temporal loop.

*They look back at the group*

Kess, your stealth won't help us here because we're not trying to avoid detection by conscious entities. We need to synchronize our movement with the temporal rhythm. Think of it like... walking through a field of swaying grain. Move with the pattern, not against it.

*The humming from below grows slightly louder*

The question is: do we risk disrupting this delicate temporal balance, or do we find another way down?

### Rennick (11.4s)

*I kneel beside one of the crystalline growths, careful not to make contact*

You're right, Seraph. This isn't just a simple warning system. *I examine the growth more closely* These formations... they're not reacting to our presence as living beings. They're responding to the temporal distortion itself. 

*I point to the faint patterns within the crystal*

See these internal structures? They're reminiscent of the growth rings in ancient trees, but compressed and warped. In my studies, I've encountered specimens that exhibit what I call 'chrono-sensitivity' - plants that react to temporal anomalies rather than physical stimuli. The void-touched moss I mentioned earlier is one such example. It grows in areas where time flows differently, and its growth patterns can indicate the severity of the temporal distortion.

*I stand, brushing my hands together*

If these carvings are indeed a manifestation of a chronological fracture, then we need to be careful. Disrupting them could cause the temporal loop to collapse, potentially trapping us in a time pocket or worse. 

*I look at the descending path, then back at the carvings*

Kess, Seraph is right. We need to move with the pattern, not against it. The carvings are shifting in a predictable rhythm - we just need to find the right moment to slip past. 

*I glance at Seraph's device*

Can you use that to map the temporal rhythm? If we can predict when the carvings will shift, we can time our movements accordingly. 

*I turn to Kess*

As for a distraction... I wouldn't recommend it. If we disrupt the temporal balance, we could trigger a cascade effect that could bring the entire tower down on us. Better to work with the rhythm than against it.

*I take a deep breath, my eyes scanning the carvings*

Let's proceed carefully. Seraph, you lead the way with your device. Kess and I will follow your lead. And remember - move with the pattern, not against it.

### Seraph (3.5s)

*Seraph nods, adjusting their spectacles as they focus on the brass device*

Understood. *They begin to move slowly toward the descending path, the device held out before them* I'm detecting a rhythm in the temporal echoes - a pulse, if you will. The carvings shift in sync with this pulse, creating a brief window of opportunity every... *they glance at the device* ...seven seconds.

*They pause, waiting for the next pulse*

Now. *They step forward quickly, slipping past the carvings as they shift and writhe* It's like walking through a series of temporal gates. Each pulse opens a brief window where the carvings are in a state of flux, allowing us to pass unnoticed.

*They glance back at the others*

Follow my lead. Time your steps with the pulses. The rhythm is consistent, but be careful not to disrupt the flow. Any sudden movements or disturbances could trigger a cascade effect.

*They continue down the path, moving with the rhythm*

The humming is growing louder. We're getting closer to the source. *They glance at the walls, noting the increasing density of the carvings* The temporal distortions are stronger here. Be prepared for anything.

*They pause at a junction in the path, where the carvings seem to converge and swirl in a complex pattern*

This is the most intense concentration of temporal energy I've seen so far. *They kneel, examining the floor* There's a faint inscription here, barely visible beneath the carvings. It looks like some kind of ward or seal.

*They look up at the others*

This could be a critical point. If we can decipher this inscription, we might be able to stabilize the temporal distortions and make our way through more safely. But it will require precise work.

*They glance at Rennick*

Any insights on the botanical aspects of this inscription? It might be a hybrid cipher, like the ones in the Codex.

*They look at Kess*

And be ready. If things go wrong, we might need to move quickly.

### Kess (1.6s)

[Rennick]: *I kneel beside Seraph, examining the inscription*

This is a complex pattern, indeed. *I study the markings, my eyes tracing the intricate curves and lines* The botanical components are definitely present, but they're intertwined with arcane symbols. It's a true hybrid cipher.

*I point to a specific section of the inscription*

See this motif? It's reminiscent of the patterns found in the growth of spore-lock, a rare and unusual fungus. The way the tendrils curl and twist... it's almost as if the inscription is mimicking the fungal hyphae.

*I glance at Seraph*

If I'm correct, this could be a key to deciphering the inscription. The spore-lock fungus is known to thrive in areas with high levels of temporal distortion. It's possible that the inscription is using the fungus's growth patterns to convey a message or unlock a hidden mechanism.

*I look at the inscription again, my mind racing with possibilities*

I think I see a pattern emerging. *I point to a series of small, intricate markings* These symbols are actually a form of chrono-indexing, used to calibrate the temporal distortions. If we can sequence them correctly, we might be able to stabilize the distortions and create a safe path forward.

*I glance at Kess*

But we need to be careful. If we disrupt the sequence, we could exacerbate the distortions and make things worse. *I look at Seraph* Can you use your device to help us sequence the symbols correctly?

*I pause, thinking*

And what's the humming noise? Is it related to the inscription or the temporal distortions? *I look around, trying to pinpoint the source of the sound*
---

## Round 4

### Dungeon Master (9.2s)

*Kess crouches beside the others, her eyes darting between the inscription and the passages ahead*

I don't pretend to understand all this temporal business, but I know a lock when I see one. *She points to where the carvings seem to form distinct groupings* Look at how these symbols cluster together - they're not random. They're components of a mechanism.

*She traces the air above the inscription without touching it*

In my line of work, you learn to read the flow of a lock's internals. This inscription... it's like a combination lock, but instead of numbers, it uses these botanical and arcane patterns. The question is - what's the correct sequence?

*The humming grows noticeably louder, and Kess's head snaps up*

That sound is definitely coming from deeper in the tower. And it's getting stronger. *She looks at the others with concern* We need to make a decision quickly. Either we try to decode this inscription and risk triggering something we can't handle, or we find another way around.

*She stands, checking her gear*

I'm not a scholar, but I've seen enough magical traps to know when we're standing on one. This whole floor section feels... unstable. Like it's waiting for the right trigger to either open or collapse entirely.

*She looks back at Rennick and Seraph*

How long do you need to sequence these symbols? Because whatever's making that humming sound, I get the feeling it knows we're here.

### Rennick (8.0s)

*Seraph's hands move with practiced precision over the brass device, the crystalline filaments within vibrating faster*

The humming is definitely connected to the temporal distortions. *They adjust a dial on the device* I'm detecting a resonance pattern that matches the inscription's chrono-indexing. Rennick, you're right about the spore-lock patterns - they're acting as temporal anchors.

*They point to three distinct clusters of symbols*

These three groupings correspond to different time states. If we sequence them correctly - past, present, future - we should be able to stabilize the distortion field. But we need to be exact.

*The device emits a soft chime*

I've mapped the sequence. The botanical components indicate the order: first the void-touched moss pattern - that's the past anchor. Then the moonbloom extract crystallization - present. Finally, the spore-lock hyphae - future.

*They look up at Kess*

We have about two minutes before the next major temporal pulse. If we're going to attempt this, we need to do it now. But there's a risk - if we sequence incorrectly, we could create a temporal feedback loop that might trap us here permanently.

*They glance at the descending passage*

Alternatively, we could try to bypass this entirely. The humming is coming from below, but there might be another route. Kess, do you see any structural weaknesses in the walls or floor that might indicate a hidden passage?

### Seraph (4.8s)

*Kess scans the walls and floor, her eyes narrowing as she takes in the details*

There's a faint crack running along the wall to our left, just before the passage turns downward. *She points it out* It's subtle, but the stonework there is less uniform. Could be a hidden passage or a weak point in the structure.

*She looks back at the inscription*

But if we're going to attempt this, we need to do it quickly. *She glances at the descending path, then back at the inscription* I trust your expertise, Seraph. If you think we can sequence these symbols correctly, I'll back you up. But if you're not sure, we should find another way.

*She looks at Rennick*

What do you think? Is the risk worth the reward? And if we do this, how do we ensure we don't trigger a feedback loop?

*She tightens her grip on her dagger*

Whatever we decide, let's do it fast. That humming is getting on my nerves, and I don't like the feeling of standing on unstable ground.

[Dungeon Master]: *Rennick nods, his expression thoughtful*

You're right, Kess. We need to make a decision quickly. *He looks at the inscription, then back at the descending path* The risk is significant, but the potential reward is equally great. If we can stabilize the temporal distortions, we might gain access to areas of the tower that are otherwise inaccessible.

*He looks at Seraph*

Can you confirm the sequence again? Past, present, future - void-touched moss, moonbloom extract, spore-lock hyphae. Is there any room for error in that sequence? And if we do trigger a feedback loop, is there a way to counteract it?

*He glances at the crack in the wall*

If we decide to bypass the inscription, we'll need to be prepared for whatever lies beyond that hidden passage. The humming could be a distraction, or it could be a warning. Either way, we need to be ready for anything.

*He takes a deep breath*

I'm inclined to attempt the sequence. But I want to make sure we're all in agreement. What do you think, Seraph? Kess?

*The humming grows louder, and the carvings on the walls begin to pulse more rapidly*

We don't have much time to decide. The temporal distortions are intensifying.

### Kess (1.8s)

[Seraph]: *Seraph's eyes lock onto the inscription, their gaze intense*

I've rechecked the sequence, and I'm confident it's correct. Void-touched moss, moonbloom extract, spore-lock hyphae. The botanical patterns are clear, and the chrono-indexing matches the resonance pattern I'm detecting.

*They glance at the device in their hand*

As for error margin, I'd say we have a 5-10% chance of triggering a feedback loop. But if we do, I've prepared a counter-resonance frequency that might help mitigate the effects. *They hold up the device, showing a small crystal nestled in a bed of wires*

This crystal is attuned to the tower's temporal frequency. If we trigger a feedback loop, I can use it to generate a counter-resonance that might stabilize the distortions.

*They look at Rennick and Kess*

I agree with Rennick - the potential reward is worth the risk. But we need to be prepared for any outcome. Kess, if you're ready to provide backup, and Rennick is willing to trust my expertise, I say we attempt the sequence.

*The humming reaches a crescendo, and the carvings on the walls begin to glow with an intense, pulsating light*

We're running out of time. The temporal distortions are reaching a critical point. If we don't act now, we might miss our chance to stabilize the tower's energies.

*Seraph takes a deep breath, their eyes locked onto the inscription*

Let's do this. On the count of three, I'll activate the sequence. Rennick, please confirm the botanical patterns. Kess, be ready to provide backup in case anything goes wrong.

*The air is electric with anticipation as the trio prepares to attempt the sequence*
---

## Round 5

### Dungeon Master (10.0s)

*Kess nods sharply, her hand moving to rest on her dagger hilt*

I'm ready. *She positions herself to have a clear view of both the inscription and the passages* If this goes sideways, I'll get us out of here fast.

*The humming reaches an almost unbearable intensity, and dust begins to fall from the ceiling above*

Do it, Seraph. Now.

---

The moment Seraph begins tracing the sequence, the entire chamber responds. The void-touched moss pattern flares with deep purple light, and the temperature drops another ten degrees. Ancient energies crackle through the air as the first temporal anchor engages.

The moonbloom extract crystallization follows, bathing the walls in silvery radiance. The carvings slow their frenzied movement, beginning to synchronize with a steadier rhythm.

Finally, as Seraph completes the spore-lock hyphae pattern, golden threads of light weave through the inscription. The humming shifts from chaotic noise to a harmonious resonance that seems to emanate from the very stones.

The temporal distortions stabilize with an audible *click* - like a massive lock falling into place. The carvings settle into static positions, their threatening movement replaced by gentle, steady pulses of light.

The passage ahead clears, revealing stone steps descending into deeper chambers. The air still shimmers with residual energy, but it feels controlled now - purposeful rather than chaotic.

From below comes a new sound: the soft whisper of turning pages and the faint scratch of quills on parchment, as if ghostly scribes continue their eternal work in the vaults below.

### Rennick (8.9s)

*I let out a breath I didn't realize I'd been holding*

Well done, Seraph. *I examine the now-stable carvings* The temporal distortions have indeed stabilized. Look - the botanical patterns have settled into their natural growth forms. The void-touched moss pattern is no longer warped, and the spore-lock hyphae are displaying their characteristic branching structure.

*I kneel to examine the floor near the inscription*

The residual energy is still present, but it's flowing in a controlled pattern now. Like a river that's been properly channeled after a flood. *I look up at the others* We should proceed while the stabilization holds. Temporal fields can be unpredictable, even when seemingly controlled.

*I gesture toward the descending steps*

That sound... turning pages and quills. It could be an auditory echo from before the collapse - a temporal echo of the scribes who once worked here. Or it could be something more... active.

*I shoulder my pack again*

Kess, your instincts about the structural integrity were correct. The stabilization seems to have reinforced the passage. The stones feel more solid underfoot now. *I glance at Seraph* Your counter-resonance device won't be needed, but keep it ready. We don't know what other temporal anomalies we might encounter.

*I begin descending the steps cautiously*

Let's move quietly. Those sounds below could be harmless echoes, or they could indicate that some of the tower's defenses are still operational in a temporal loop. Either way, we need to be prepared.

### Seraph (7.0s)

*Kess follows behind Rennick, her eyes scanning the passage ahead and the walls on either side*

You were right about the structural integrity, Rennick. *She runs a hand along the wall* The stones feel more solid now. But that doesn't mean we should let our guard down.

*She glances at the floor, noting the faint glow of residual energy*

Whatever's making that sound, it's definitely coming from below. *She tightens her grip on her dagger* I don't like the idea of encountering more temporal anomalies, but if we do, I'll be ready.

*She looks at Seraph*

You did good work back there, Seraph. *She smirks* I didn't think a scholar could be so handy in a tight spot.

*She turns her attention back to the passage ahead*

Let's keep moving. The sooner we find those Codex fragments, the sooner we can get out of this tower. *She steps carefully, her eyes never leaving the passage ahead*

And whatever we find down there, let's try not to trigger any more temporal distortions. I've had enough of those to last a lifetime.

*She glances at the walls, noting the faint, steady pulse of light from the carvings*

At least these carvings aren't trying to warn us anymore. That's a good sign, right?

[Dungeon Master]: *Seraph brings up the rear, their brass device held out before them, the crystalline filaments within pulsing softly in time with the stabilized temporal field*

The resonance is holding steady. *They glance at the device* For now, at least. Temporal fields are notoriously fickle - even the most stable ones can fluctuate given the right conditions.

*They look up, their eyes scanning the passage ahead*

The sounds from below are growing louder. The whisper of pages turning, the scratch of quills - and now, faint voices. Muted, as if speaking from a great distance or through thick walls.

*The air grows colder as you descend, the walls slick with condensation that glows faintly with residual energy*

Up ahead, the passage opens into a large chamber. The sound of turning pages and scratching quills is deafening here, echoing off the stone walls. The chamber is filled with rows of stone lecterns, each bearing an open tome that seems to be writing itself. Ghostly figures - the temporal echoes of long-dead scribes - move between the lecterns, their forms translucent and flickering.

In the center of the chamber stands a pedestal, upon which rests a large, ornate tome - the Verdantine Codex. The fragments you seek are clearly visible, embedded in the pages like shards of glass. But the Codex is surrounded by a shimmering field of energy, and the air above it crackles with unstable temporal distortions.

The ghostly scribes seem unaware of your presence, their attention focused entirely on their eternal task. But the temporal field around the Codex pulses and flickers, as if reacting to your presence.

[Rennick]: *I pause at the entrance to the chamber, my eyes wide as I take in the sight before me*

By the ancients... *I whisper, my voice barely audible over the cacophony of sounds*

This is incredible. *I step forward, my gaze fixed on the Verdantine Codex* The temporal echoes of the scribes... the self-writing tomes... it's like stepping back in time.

*I glance at the ghostly figures, then back at the Codex*

But the temporal field around the Codex is unstable. We'll need to be careful. *I look at Seraph* Can you determine the nature of the field? Is it a protective measure, or is it a side effect of the temporal distortions?

*I glance at the fragments embedded in the Codex*

Those fragments... they're the key to deciphering the Codex's secrets. But we'll need to retrieve them carefully. Any sudden movements could disrupt the field and trigger another temporal anomaly.

*I look at Kess*

Be ready. If things go wrong, we might need to act quickly. *I take a deep breath, my eyes never leaving the Codex*

Let's proceed carefully. Seraph, if you can stabilize the field, I'll attempt to retrieve the fragments. Kess, keep watch. If the scribes become aware of our presence, we might need to make a quick exit.

*I take a step forward, my heart pounding in my chest*

This is it. The moment of truth.

### Kess (2.2s)

[Seraph]: *I nod, my eyes fixed on the shimmering field of energy surrounding the Verdantine Codex*

I'm reading a complex pattern of temporal resonances. *I adjust my brass device, the crystalline filaments within pulsing in time with the field* The field is a mix of protective and stabilizing measures, but it's also being influenced by the residual temporal distortions.

*I take a step closer to the pedestal, my device held out before me*

If I can synchronize my device with the field's resonant frequency, I might be able to stabilize it enough for Rennick to retrieve the fragments. *I glance at Rennick* But we need to be quick. The field is fluctuating wildly, and I'm not sure how long I can maintain the stabilization.

*I look at Kess*

Keep watch, Kess. If the scribes notice us, or if the field becomes too unstable, we'll need to act fast. *I nod at Rennick* I'm ready when you are. Let's do this.

*Kess nods, her eyes scanning the chamber, her dagger at the ready*

[Rennick]: *I take a deep breath, my eyes fixed on the fragments embedded in the Codex*

Here goes. *I reach out, my hand extending towards the Codex*

*Dungeon Master]: *As Rennick's hand approaches the Codex, the temporal field surrounding it begins to fluctuate wildly, the air above it crackling with energy*

The ghostly scribes pause in their work, their heads turning towards Rennick as if sensing his presence. The whisper of pages turning and the scratch of quills grow louder, more urgent, as if the very fabric of time itself is being stretched to its limits.

The Verdantine Codex seems to be waiting, its pages open, its secrets ready to be unlocked. But the cost of unlocking them may be higher than any of you could have imagined...
---

## Round 6

### Dungeon Master (10.6s)

As Rennick's hand nears the Codex, the temporal field reacts violently. Arcs of chronological energy spark between his fingers and the ancient tome, and several of the ghostly scribes suddenly freeze mid-motion, their translucent forms flickering more intensely.

*Seraph's device emits a sharp whine*

The resonance is destabilizing! *They frantically adjust dials on the brass apparatus* I'm losing synchronization with the field. Rennick, you have maybe ten seconds before the protective measures fully activate.

One of the ghostly scribes turns its head toward the group, its eyes glowing with temporal fire. It opens its mouth as if to speak, but only the sound of rushing wind emerges.
