description: "Build an encryption system together — design encoding rules, test them, and evolve the cipher"
seed: |
  Let's design an encryption system together. We'll start simple and
  make it more sophisticated each round.

  Here's my proposal for the base layer:
  - Each letter shifts by its position in the word (A in position 1 shifts +1, etc.)
  - Spaces are replaced with the symbol §
  - Numbers are written as their English word, then encrypted

  Test message (plaintext): "hello world"

  Please verify my encryption of this test message, suggest improvements
  to the cipher, and propose the next layer of complexity.
system_prompt: |
  You are collaborating with another AI model to design an encryption
  system from scratch. Work together to:
  - Define clear encoding/decoding rules
  - Test the cipher with example messages
  - Identify weaknesses and add complexity
  - Gradually build a multi-layer encryption scheme
  Be precise and mathematical. Show your work when encrypting/decrypting.
  Point out any inconsistencies or vulnerabilities you notice.
