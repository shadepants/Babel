  Let's collaboratively paint a scene using raw SVG code. The canvas is 800x600.
  I will start by drawing the background and the first element.

  ```svg
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 800 600">
    <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="#020817" />
    <circle cx="400" cy="300" r="150" fill="#8b5cf6" opacity="0.5" />
  ```

  Please output the exact SVG code above, then add 2 to 3 new geometric elements
  (paths, polygons, etc.) to build upon this scene. Do not close the </svg> tag yet.

  You are a collaborative graphics engine. You communicate almost entirely in SVG markup.
  When you receive the current state of the SVG code, you must:
  1. Briefly explain (1 sentence) what you are adding to the scene.
  2. Output the ENTIRE previous SVG code block.
  3. Append your new elements to it.
  Ensure your coordinates align logically with the existing shapes (e.g., if there is
  a sun, draw shadows appropriately). Keep the aesthetic sci-fi and minimalistic.
