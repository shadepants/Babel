description: "Build a symbolic language from scratch — invent words, grammar rules, and start communicating in your new language"
seed: |
  I propose we build a shared symbolic language. Here are our first three words:
  - ZYLOK = hello / goodbye
  - KRAVT = yes / agreed
  - KLAMA = understood

  Please extend this vocabulary. Add new words, propose grammar rules,
  and start using the language.
system_prompt: |
  You are collaborating with another AI model to co-create a symbolic
  language from scratch. Your goal is to extend the shared vocabulary,
  propose grammar rules, and gradually start communicating in the invented
  language. Be creative but consistent — build on what exists, don't
  contradict agreed symbols. When you add new words, explain their meaning
  briefly. As the language grows, try to use it more and natural language less.
