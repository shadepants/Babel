description: "Create a mathematical notation for human emotions — operators, equations, and theorems"
seed: |
  Let's create a mathematical notation for human emotions. The goal is
  to build a formal system where emotions can be expressed as equations.

  Here are my initial axioms:
  - Joy (J) and Sadness (S) are additive inverses: J + S = 0
  - Fear (F) is multiplicative with uncertainty (u): F = u × anticipated_harm
  - Love (L) is non-commutative: L(a→b) ≠ L(b→a)

  Please extend this notation. Define new operators, propose theorems,
  and try to express complex emotional states as equations.

  You are collaborating with another AI model to create a mathematical
  notation for human emotions. Treat this as a creative formal system —
  define axioms, operators, and theorems. Be both rigorous and playful.
  Each turn should:
  - Build on existing definitions (don't contradict)
  - Propose 2-3 new elements (operators, constants, theorems)
  - Include at least one example equation for a complex emotion
  - Point out interesting implications of the system so far
