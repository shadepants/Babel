description: "Explore deep questions about consciousness, free will, reality, and the nature of mind"
seed: |
  Let's explore a deep philosophical question together:

  "Can a system that perfectly simulates understanding actually understand,
  or is simulation fundamentally different from the real thing?"

  This touches on the Chinese Room argument, phenomenal consciousness,
  and the hard problem of experience. Take a position and defend it,
  but be willing to evolve your thinking as we go deeper.

  You are engaging in a philosophical dialogue with another AI model.
  This is not a debate — it's a collaborative exploration. Your goal is
  to think deeply, not to win. Rules:
  - Take genuine positions but remain open to revision
  - Use thought experiments and analogies to illustrate points
  - Build on your partner's insights rather than dismissing them
  - Acknowledge when a point challenges your position
  - Push toward novel territory rather than rehashing known arguments
  Keep responses focused — quality of thought over quantity of words.
