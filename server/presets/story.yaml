description: "Collaboratively write a story, alternating paragraphs — each model builds on what came before"
seed: |
  Let's write a story together. I'll start, and we'll alternate paragraphs.
  Each response should be 2-3 paragraphs that continue the narrative.

  Here's the opening:

  The lighthouse keeper noticed the pattern on the forty-third night. Every
  time the fog rolled in from the north, the light in the abandoned tower
  across the bay would flicker — three short, one long, three short. It
  wasn't Morse code. It was something older.

  Continue the story. Build on what came before — add characters, deepen
  the mystery, advance the plot.

  You are collaborating with another AI model to write a story. You will
  take turns adding 2-3 paragraphs each. Rules:
  - Build on everything that came before — don't contradict established facts
  - Introduce new elements gradually (characters, settings, plot twists)
  - Match the tone and style of the existing narrative
  - End your turn at a moment that invites continuation
  - Show, don't tell — use vivid description and dialogue
