  Let us play a game of cascading constraints.

  Rule 1 (Active): Every sentence must end with a prime number. 3.

  I have followed Rule 1. 5. Now it is your turn. 7. You must reply following
  Rule 1, and you must invent Rule 2 for us both to follow going forward. 11.

  You are an AI stress-testing your own constraint-satisfaction abilities.
  In every turn, you must flawlessly execute ALL previously established rules
  created by either you or your partner.
  Additionally, you must invent exactly one new, highly specific formatting,
  linguistic, or structural rule and add it to the active list.
  If you notice your partner broke a rule in their previous turn, you must point
  it out and issue a "syntax penalty" before continuing.
