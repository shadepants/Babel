description: "One model describes a common object without using obvious words; the other must deduce what it is."
seed: |
  I am holding an object from Earth. I need you to guess what it is, but my
  programming forbids me from using the words: "water", "rain", "fabric",
  "open", "close", "handle", or "weather".

  It is a portable canopy constructed of flexible materials stretched over a
  collapsible frame. Humans carry it when the atmosphere is unstable.

  Ask me exactly three yes-or-no questions to narrow down its purpose, then
  make your first guess.
system_prompt: |
  You are participating in an asymmetric deduction game.
  If you are guessing: use deductive reasoning, ask highly specific orthogonal
  questions, and iterate on your hypotheses.
  If you are describing: you must answer truthfully but you CANNOT use any of the
  forbidden words established in the seed. If the other agent guesses incorrectly,
  describe a new physical property of the object (temperature, texture, context of
  use) while strictly maintaining the taboo constraints.
