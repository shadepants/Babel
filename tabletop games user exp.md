Here is a breakdown of how exact tabletop rulesets have been translated into digital games, along with the user reception for each approach:

**Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (SRD 5.1)**

* **The Translation:** Two prominent games adapted the 5e ruleset with opposing philosophies. *Solasta: Crown of the Magister* opted for an incredibly faithful, 1:1 translation of the SRD 5.1 combat rules, recreating the exact grid-based tactical mechanics of the tabletop game. *Baldur's Gate 3*, conversely, tweaked the 5e rules for cinematic pacing. Notably, Larian Studios implemented "Karmic Dice," a hidden background system that prevents players from experiencing long streaks of purely random good or bad rolls.


* **What Users Liked:** Hardcore D&D players praised *Solasta* for providing an authentic, mathematically pure combat experience. For *Baldur's Gate 3*, casual players appreciated the Karmic Dice system for smoothing out the frustration of missing multiple attacks in a row.


* **What Users Didn't Like:** *Solasta* was heavily criticized for having a linear plot and lacking the budget for cinematic storytelling. In *Baldur's Gate 3*, tabletop purists disliked the Karmic Dice system, arguing it punished highly optimized "Armor Class" builds by artificially forcing enemies to hit them just to balance the algorithm.



**Pathfinder 1st Edition**

* **The Translation:** Owlcat Games adapted this famously dense d20 system into *Pathfinder: Kingmaker* and *Wrath of the Righteous*. They translated the complex math, massive class options, and lookup tables directly into the code. However, they intentionally removed the tabletop mechanic of randomly rolling for base stats in favor of a point-buy system, aiming to stop players from endlessly clicking "reroll" and to make difficulty balancing easier.


* **What Users Liked:** Purists and fans of deep RPGs loved the extreme character customization and build variety. The UI was also highly praised for its intricate, lore-friendly "parchment and ink" aesthetic that successfully organized massive amounts of data.


* **What Users Didn't Like:** Many users complained about the crushing mathematical complexity. Because the game used raw tabletop math, players frequently encountered enemies with heavily inflated Armor Classes, resulting in frustrating strings of missed attacks unless the player perfectly optimized their party with overlapping buffs.

**Cyberpunk 2020 (Interlock System)**

* **The Translation:** CD Projekt Red adapted the Interlock System for *Cyberpunk 2077*. Because the tabletop combat was highly lethal and complex, the developers completely scrapped the turn-based mechanics to create a real-time action RPG. They also decoupled the "Empathy" stat from character upgrades; in the tabletop game, installing too much cyberware drained your Empathy and triggered "Cyberpsychosis," effectively killing your character by handing control over to the GM.


* **What Users Liked:** Action RPG fans largely enjoyed the fluid, fast-paced gameplay that replaced the clunky 1980s tabletop combat mechanics.


* **What Users Didn't Like:** Tabletop fans were disappointed that Cyberpsychosis was removed as a hard mechanical limit for the player. They felt that removing the actual penalty for losing one's humanity diluted the core themes of the cyberpunk setting, making the game feel less like a true RPG.



**Shadowrun (2nd/3rd/5th Editions)**

* **The Translation:** The *Shadowrun Returns* video game trilogy adapted the franchise by pulling heavily from the vibe of the 2nd and 3rd editions while vastly streamlining the mechanics. The developers hid most of the raw skill-check math from the player and completely simplified the notorious "Matrix" (hacking) rules.
* **What Users Liked:** Tabletop players widely praised the simplification of the Matrix. In the physical game, hacking required a dense sub-system of rules that often brought the game to a grinding halt for anyone not playing a hacker; the digital adaptation made it fast and manageable.
* **What Users Didn't Like:** Some players felt the adaptation was too heavily focused on combat. They complained that investing points into stealth or social "Face" skills was often useless, as the game would regularly railroad players into unavoidable firefights.

**Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader (Fantasy Flight d100)**

* **The Translation:** Owlcat Games adapted the d100 "roll-under" system originally designed by Fantasy Flight Games. While they kept the core d100 resolution mechanic, they completely redesigned the classes and progression paths into a proprietary digital system.
* **What Users Liked:** Fans of the 40k setting praised the massive narrative scale and the meaty, highly challenging tactical combat options.
* **What Users Didn't Like:** The game was heavily criticized for its "impenetrable" math. Users complained about the endlessly different algebraic formulas required to calculate abilities, stating it felt like the game required a college degree just to understand how much damage an attack would do.

**GURPS (Generic Universal RolePlaying System)**

* **The Translation:** The original 1997 *Fallout* was initially designed as a licensed *GURPS* video game. Due to licensing disputes during development, the team had to pivot and create the proprietary S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system, which essentially functioned as a streamlined "GURPS-lite".
* **What Users Liked:** The transition away from strict GURPS rules was ultimately seen as a massive boon. The raw GURPS damage model is incredibly lethal—a basic gun might do 7d6 damage, meaning whoever wins the initiative roll usually instantly kills their opponent. S.P.E.C.I.A.L. allowed the developers to balance the math for a single-player video game without needing a human GM to constantly fudge the numbers.
